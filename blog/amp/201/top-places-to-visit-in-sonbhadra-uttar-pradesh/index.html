The dam comprises 61 independent blocks and ground joints. The powerhouse is situated at the toe of the dam, with installed capacity of 300 MW (6 units of 50 MW each). The Intake Structure is situated between blocks no. 28 to 33. The Dam is in distress condition. It is proposed to carry out the rehabilitation works in the dam and the powerhouse. The F.R.L. of the dam is 268.22 m and it impounds 8.6 Million Acre ft of water. It is one of the biggest reservoir by its gross storage capacity in India but sufficient water is not flowing in to the reservoir. The construction of the dam resulted in forced relocation of nearly 100,000 people Many super thermal power stations are located in the catchment area of the dam. These are Singrauli, Vindyachal, Rihand, Anpara &amp; Sasan super thermal power stations and Renukoot thermal station. The high alkalinity run off water from the ash dumps (some are located in the reservoir area) of these coal-fired power stations ultimately collects in this reservoir enhancing its water alkalinity and pH. Using high alkalinity water for irrigation converts the agriculture fields in to fallow Alkali soils.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After identification and discovery of one more fossil park in Sonebhadra district. the district has found its place not only in Uttar Pradesh but also on the world map. The district has this honour as two fossil parks were found in a district and a Vikas Khand. Now the Sonebhadra district is being considered as a lucky place where the first evidence of life on earth was found. After the discovery of a large number of fossils there, the possibility of finding hydrocarbon. uranium and phosphorite has increased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new fossil park of Badagaon was discovered when Dr. Mukund Sharma, a scientist of the Birbal Sahani Institute in Lucknow were at the fossil park in Salkhan village.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, a shepherd came there and asked them to follow him. They reached Jata Shankar Pahari of Badagoan village and observed that the fossils of Salkhan and Badagaon villages were similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, they came to the conclusion that these fossils were stramatolite and were over 150-crore-year-old. After studying and research, the fact came to light that the geologist John Oadon had accepted the presence of fossils but did not brief the people about their creation. He described these fossils as lime-stone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mukund Sharma said that the discover of fossils in Salkhan and Badagaon villages would help in counting the days of a solar year.</p>
