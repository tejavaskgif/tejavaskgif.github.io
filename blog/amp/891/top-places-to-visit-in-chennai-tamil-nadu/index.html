It is the smallest of all the districts in the state, but has the highest population density. The district is a city district which means that it does not have a district headquarters. Most of the Greater Chennai City comes under this district, erstwhile under Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu districts. As of 2011, the district had a population of 8,946,732 with a sex-ratio of 989 females for every 1,000 males.</p>

It constituted most of Chennai from its settlement by the peoples in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of Chennai, though it remains a notable part of central Chennai. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Tamil Nadu. However, the City of Chennai is not only a metro area it is a megacity. It is also having a separate 3 revenue division of Chennai, being an enclave surrounded by Chennai metropolitan area. It is the smallest district in the Tamil Nadu.</p>

Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the Chennai metropolitan area's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City. The name Chennai is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City. Chennai most often denotes the sprawling Chennai metropolis, or the 2 districts of Tamil Nadu, in addition to the City of Chennai itself. This wider usage of Chennai is documented as far back as 1639, when the madras municipal corporation was created.</p>
