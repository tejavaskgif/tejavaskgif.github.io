<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>National protected area</p>
<p>Namdapha National Park</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>The Dihing is the main source of fishes for the local people.The fresh water fishes are very much in demand they hardly reach major towns nearby like Tinsukia, Doomdooma, Digboi and Dibrugarh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Administrative divisions</p>
<p>There are 5 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies located in this district: Bordumsa, Miao, Nampong, Changlang South and Changlang North. All of these are part of Arunachal East Lok Sabha constituency.[5]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Changlang district has five Sub-Divisions namely Changlang, Manmao, Jairampur, Bordumsa and Miao.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changlang Sub-Divisions (Chanlang Block) covers four circles, namely Changlang (14,718 people), Khimiyang (3,506 people), Namtok (3,085 people) and Yatdam.</p>

                        <h2>1. Vijoynagar</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/0bb6d803-0072-4edb-8f06-9d9e6f2c7939_Vijoynagar.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Vijaynagar is the eastern most people&rsquo;s inhabited land of our country which is also the remotest Circle (Tehsil) of Changlang district in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, India. This beautiful pristine location is endowed with natural beauty and surrounded on three sides by Myanmar while the other side is flanked by the large chunk of thick forest of Namdapha National Park. Nearby towns are Miao which is 157 km away and take about 6 days walk by foot march. The other nearest town located in other districts in India side are Hayuliang and Tezu. The nearest town in Myanmar side is Putao which is 40 km away. Vijoynagar&rsquo;s local name is &ldquo;Daudi&rdquo; called by Lisu (Yobin) people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vijonagar, comprises of sixteen villages having a population of 4438 people The villagers depend on Wetland and Jhoom Cultivation for their livelihood, and are dependent on rainfall. The Day to day requirement of Groceries is met by a few Shops; and which bring the Stores from Dibrugarh by Air or from Miao on foot. It takes six days to travel on foot from Vijoynagar to Miao. In Vijoynagar, Salt and Sugar are sold at minimum Rs 200 per Kilogram. Limited Civil and Military Helicopters (AN 32) fly from Dibrugarh and Miao to Vijoynagar Airfield which are also very irregular and limited haulage capacity. In that they can take up to one ton load with eighteen persons on board. Previously there were two such Sorties for Civilians and three numbers for Assam Rifle personnel before last Helicopter crashed incidence at Tirap district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As there is no road connection to the area, people are dependent on Military Helicopter for essential services and requirements. Fifty five percent of the population belong to retired Assam Rifle personnel and 45 percent is of Civilians comprising of mainly Lisu (Yobin) people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settlement of the Assam Rifle personnel began from May 7, 1961 onwards. Prior to 1961, this place was little known to outside World. The villages have a number of Primary Schools. There is Arunachal Pradesh Government run Secondary School up to Ten standard. There are only one or two teachers in each school. Many years back there was a motorable road existing in the area, but due to deterioration, it is no longer exist. The telecommunication facilities are not available, and only Radio Net communications are available in the Assam Rifles Camp. Detachment of Government Agencies like SIB and Arunachal Pradesh Police exist in the area. Assam Rifles camp has limited medical facilities. During emergency medical cases when patients have to be go out for urgent treatment, it is very difficult for people to avail medical facility outside Vijoynagar. The villagers are not covered under water supply scheme and draw raw water for their consumption. Power Department has installed Generator set for Power supply, but due to non availability of funds for procuring Diesel, the Generator is not functional. Few solar power lights were installed couple of years, but they are also not working properly now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since couple of years, it has been reported that there is proposal from government for construction of road from Miao to Vijoynagar which is yet to be undertaken by the authority. The people of Vijoynagar are eagerly waiting for a motorable road since long at least to minimize their hardship in going in and out from Vijoynagar especially during emergency cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The road is the lifeline of a developed society; Without road there is no development.</p></p>
                        <h2>2. Lake of no return</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/5d7e25f8-43f9-46ab-a211-a9e1aaf05f7e_Lake-of-no-return.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Nampong is a quaint small town situated in the picturesque scenic valley. All along the way from Jairampur to Nampong one can enjoy the nature&rsquo;s ride and the sight of beautiful terraced tea gardens. The close proximity of the town is Burma border make it very crucial &amp; important. Three days Border Trading markets are open as Bazar days in a month on 10th, 20th and 30th of the month at Nampong for selling and buying of goods for both Indian and Myanmarese nationals. During these three days, people are allowed to cross international border at Pangsau Pass with due permission from the concern authority. The Government has declared Nampong as international trading hub. 20 Km from Nampong one can see World War II Observatory post at Wintong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historic Stilwell Road (Ledo Road) passing through the Nampong and goes down to Burma from here. It is threshold of the Indo-Burma (Myanmar) border. The Pangsau Pass, the Indo-Burma (Myanmar) border is just 12 Km away from Nampong where the famous the Lake of no Return can be viewed from the Pass. Nampong and Pangsau Pass were considered to be &ldquo;Hell gate&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hell Pass&rdquo; due to difficult terrains in the Indo-Burma Patkai mountain Range. Crossing these places toward Burma were considered to be dangerous and hazardous as Hell during the World War II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The famous lake called The Lake of no return in Myanmar side which can be viewed from Pangsau pass is 12 Km away from Nampong. During World War II, large numbers of Aircrafts were reported to have perished into this lake. Perhaps, the lake served the Allied Pilots for soft landing into the lake water during return mission when the Aircrafts got hit by enemy or out of mechanical snags in the Aircraft. During World War II, flying over &ldquo;the Hump&rdquo;&rdquo;, many transport planes were crashed in and around China-Burma-India borders junction when air supply from Assam, India to Allied soldiers who were fighting with Japanese forces in China and north Burma (Myanmar) were undergoing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pilots had chosen this lake for an emergency landing in case of imminent Air crush and therefore, many aircraft were reported to have perished into the lake.</p></p>
                        <h2>3. Namdapha National Park</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/0400b3f4-7d7d-446e-8bca-acbfdab75023_Namdapha-National-Park.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Namdapha, a National Park and Tiger Reservek, a true wilderness and enchanting beauty of lush green vegetation, impenetrable pristine and virgin forests covered an area of 1985.23 square kilometres having diverse flora and fauna lies in the international border between India and Myanmar(Burma) within Changlang District in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Namdapha National Park is located at a few kilometre away from Miao amidst misty blue hills along the turbulent Noa-Dihing river lies in the sprawling tropical rain forest. It was declared as Tiger Reserve by the Government in 1983.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beautiful forests possess great biodiversity of Flora and Fauna. A details study of its species and genetic variation has not yet been thoroughly done. Namdapha is Botanist&rsquo;s dream and it may take as long as 50 years to complete a comprehensive survey of its botanical resources.</p></p>
                        <h2>4. World War II Cemetery</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/91dbb966-05ea-42a0-8eab-d151faf9ce65_World-War-II-Cemetery.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The recently unearthed large Burial-ground with about 1,000 graves of allied soldiers believed to be mostly of Chinese, Kachins, Indian, Britishers and Americans soldiers who died in Second World War is located at Stilwell Road ( Ledo Road ) in the Jairampur-Nampong road, Changlang district, Arunachal Pradesh, India. The hidden cemetery covered with thick jungles midst of the bank of Namchik River and on the Stilwell Road ( Ledo Road ), 6 km from Jairampur town, 39 km from Ledo and 24 Km before reaching Pangsau Pass ( Hell Pass ), India &ndash; Burma (Myanmar) border. The Army has cleared the area and found about 1,000 graves within an area of about three acre. The boundary was enclosed by concrete posts with entrance on three sides. The graves are arranged in five Lines and several rows. A large grave, possibly a mass burial, is in the centre. The bricks were from Ledo AR&amp;T Co&rsquo;s brick fields, and others marked as B&amp;C-119 and IR.N!C9 were being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most of the graves in the Cemetery are damaged due to wild Elephants, wear and tear in the course of time and tempered due to miscreants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, this cemetery might have constructed during the construction of the Stilwell Road ( Ledo Road ) from Ledo, India to Kunming, China via Burma connecting the Burma Road beyond Bhamo by allied forces starting from December 1942 to May 1945 in China-Burma-India (CBI) theatre of military operation against the Japanese forces in North Burma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the construction of road and fighting against the Japanese forces, numbers of allied soldiers were reported to have died due to malaria, dysentery, land slides, enemy fires and other causes. The Patkai range of Indo-Burma border and Shindbwiyang range in north Burma were one of the most difficult terrains in the World where the road construction was carried out by the allied forces led by General Joseph W. Stilwell while fighting against the Japanese forces who had taken over the whole Burma in their hand in 1942. The cemetery was believed to be used for disposal of dead soldiers from site of war front and calamities out of road construction in India and Burma fronts. While trekking and fighting down the Ledo Road to Myitkyina, Burma, the stronghold of Japanese forces, large number of allied soldiers were reported to have died due to Diseases, calamities and missed in action while fighting.The casualties at war fronts in Burma were reported to have been evacuated by C-47&rsquo;s Ambulance planes and treated at the various base Hospitals at Ledo road and at Ledo, Assam, India and most of the dead soldiers might have disposed off at this cemetery. It is also reported that most of the casualties were treated at the 20th General Hospital, the 14th Evacuation Hospital, or the 111th Station Hospital in the Ledo area. In course of time, those Hospitals have also completely vanished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Excerpt of inscription extracted from the Epitaph of comparatively larger grave inscribed in Chinese language, shown in right hand side photo is belongs to Late Major Hsiao Chu Ching, Company Commander 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion of 10th Regiment, Independent Engineers of Chinese Army stationed in India. He was born in July 1913 at Wei Country of of Hapeh province, and died in December 1943. `All officers and men of the Second Company &ndash; January 5, 1944.&rsquo;</p></p>
