                        <h2>5. Archaeological Museum Jamnagar</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/e643c236-aeb1-4e75-a103-be86e6a21906_Archaeological-Museum-Jamnagar.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The rulers of Nawanagar state were very much interested in the progress and development work of this state along with the preservation of historical and cultural heritage. The establishment of archaeological organization is an excellent example of the interest and encouragement of Jam Shri Digvijay Singhji. In addition, to install a museum at Jamnagar, the Lakhota Kotha was allocated to the State Archaeological Department and for this, his personal collection was also given to the museum. Thus, the Archaeological Museum was started in 1946 in the Lakhota Kotha, which is now functional under the Gujarat State Archaeology and Museum Department since 1960. The newly renovated building of Lakhota Kotha was actually constructed in 1846, was damaged during the 2001 Earthquake. Therefore, the necessary and substantial restoration, conservation and rehabilitation project was taken up by the joint ventures of the Gujarat State Archaeological Department and Jamnagar Municipal Corporation. Shri Vijay Rupaniji, Chief Minister of Gujarat, reopened the glorified Lakhota Kotha as well as reorganized Museum on May 5th, 2018 and have declared it open for the public.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lakhota Kotho&nbsp; The central island structure of Lakhota Kotha (type of water fort &ndash; Jal Durga) in Ranamal lake was constructed in the year 1846 for the drought relief by Jam Shri Ranamalji. It has been named after Lakhaji &ndash; a ruler of Nawanagar. It is also believed that the &ldquo;1 lakh koris&rdquo; (the currency of Nawanagar) had been spent in the construction of the Kotho, hence the name is Lakhota. Architecturally, it is built in Rajput style and have the influence of Iranian architecture. Initially, due to its location, Lakhota Kotho served for defensive purpose and as a leisure palace for the rulers. But, it had been changed over the time and now has become the heart of city, one of the most serene and heritage monuments in Jamnagar that functions at present as District Museum. Also, due to its historical importance, the Lakhota Kotho is Protected Monument under the State Government of Gujarat.&nbsp; Archaeological Museum. The Archaeological Museum housed in Lakhota Kotha has been reorganized and redisplayed with the addition of new attraction by keeping in consideration that the visitors do appreciate the architectural splendor of the Fort. Also, being a cultural institution, it endeavors to create awareness and sensitivity towards our rich heritage through a visitor-friendly museum for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment of the public. The museum collection includes stone and bronze sculptures, miniature paintings, glassware, coins, currency plates, copper plates, regional textiles with embroidery and beadworks, natural history specimen and royal arsenals. It represents the past from 9th to 19th centuries of Jamnagar District with emphasis to Princely State Nawanagar. Thus, after the Restoration, Conservation and Rehabilitation Project of Lakhota Kotha in 2018, now Archaeological Museum represents the cultural heritage and regional history of Jamnagar in 11 sections through 321 exhibits to celebrate our legacy and to experience authentic and significant art and artifacts in meaningful context. In other words, the Archaeological Museum, Jamnagar serves as epitome of district identity.</p>
