                    <p><p>Bargarh is a municipality in Bargarh district in the state of Odisha, India. It is the administrative headquarters of Bargarh District . Popularly known for rice cultivation (parboiled-rice) therefore called "Bhata Handi" of Odisha State.</p>
<p>Bargarh District is an administrative district of Odisha state in eastern India. The city of Bargarh is its district headquarters. The district was carved out of the erstwhile district of Sambalpur in 1 April 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geography</p>
<p>Bargarh is located in Main part of Koshal, close to the border of neighbouring state of Chhattisgarh. It is positioned at 21.33&deg;N 83.62&deg;E with an average elevation of 171 meter (561 feet). The whole of Bargarh district lies in the Plain with Eastern Ghats running close to the town. As per the earthquake zoning of India, Bargarh falls in the zone 2 category, the least earthquake prone zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headquarter of Bargarh district lies on the NH 6, Kolkata to Mumbai, hence well connected to the rest of the country with well-constructed road. The Railway Station (Code - BRGA) is served by DBK Railway running from Jharsuguda to Titilagarh. The station is just 4 km off the main town. The nearest Airport is at Raipur (CG) (220 km) and Bhubaneswar (OD)(350 km). The best period of the year to visit this place is between October to March. During this period the Dhanu Yatra Festival (reportedly World's largest open air theatre) is observed here. There are a number of good hotels beside a Government Circuit House and a Guest houses in the district to provide accommodation to tourists and VIP visitors. The nearby tourist spots are well connected to the district headquarters with decent communication facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nrusinghnath</p>
<p>Nrusinghnath is situated at a distance of 112 km from Bargarh. Being a lone pilgrim spot, it has been appealing the minds of lakhs of people, with magical glitters, for the last so many centuries. This is the Dawning &ndash; place of the mention Lord Nrushinghnath, the presiding Deity of the sacred mount Gandhamardhan&ndash; endearing multitude of memories, surprisingly amalgamating the legends of the Ramayan, the Mahabharat, the Buddhist Era; even reminiscent of Bhoj Raj, Kabir and Tantracharya Nagarjuna (the preserver of all scripture). Nrusinghnath is a form of Hindu Lord Vishnu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gandhamardan</p>
<p>In the Tretayuga (the Silver Age), Jambavan (the unerring counselor of Rama) had suggested Hanuman to bring Bisalyakarani ere dawn, so that Lakshmana would rise back to life. It was in the middle of the war between Lord Rama and Ravana. Hanuman failed to identify the particular herb and carried on his shoulders a huge Himalayan mass. While flying above and proceeding toward Lanka (the kingdom of Ravana), a portion dropped down. Gandhamardan is synonymous to that portion only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hiuen T'sang</p>
<p>Glowing tributes is paid to Hiuen T'sang, the champion Chinese traveller, who was attracted by the scenic splendour of Gandhamardan, during his tour to Dakhin Koshal (part of which is current Chhatishgarh and the bewitching colourful zone of Western Odisha). He has spoken of the flowering Buddhist University of PARIMALGIRI (po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li), which had its campus on the picturesque Gandhamardan hills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecological Pyramid</p>
<p>Besides being a home of more than 5000 rare medicinal herbs (some hitherto - unidentified), providing medicines for fatal diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, leprosy, filarial, epilepsy, asthma, kidney and lever dysfunctions even AIDS, Gandhamardan serves as a wildlife sanctuary for large number of rare species of birds and animals and there by donating its portions towards balancing the Global Ecological Pyramid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Temple</p>
<p>The foundation for the temple was laid down by Baijal Dev on 17 March 1413 AD. as per inscriptions. The temple of Lord Nrushinghnath is only 45 ft (14 m) high. It is divided into two parts; the first being the seat of the Lord &ndash; a short, raised narrow plinth and the other Jaga Mohan (the antechamber) having three gates and is supported by four pillars, the like found nowhere in Odisha. The rocks used in the Jaga Mohan pillars are of rare kind. They are not seen in the Gandhamardan hills. Believed that, from far off places, Baijal Dev had brought them. With a soft rubbing, these rocks begin to scintillate, to a degree. While entering inside the inner-sanctum, one can see the rock statues of Nav Grahas (the Nine planets of Astrology) in a line. The other beautiful sculptures include the statutes of Ganga, Jamuna, Nandi, Jaya-Vijaya, Trividram and three conspicuous manifestations i.e. Bamana, Baraha and Samhar Nrusimha. The eight-handed Ganesh and the Cow-herd Sahadev are not inserted, rather they are carved on embedded prototype, near Nav Durga. The original idol of Nrusinganath is also kept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Papaharini</p>
<p>The main perennial flow of Gandhamardan is Papaharini, literally meaning, destroyer of sins. It is symbolic of Sanatan-the continuum of past, present and future. Flowing out of the confluence of seven fountains, called Saptadhar&ndash; it has an average width of 12 ft. No man-made tributary can flow into it. Nothing can pollute or adulterate it. Running about 25 km it has touched the Ang tributary and finally embraced Mahanadi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mighty Mandap</p>
<p>Via Satyaam, as one goes from Nrusimhanath to Harishankar an old-patterned cave is caught in sight. It is just 10.5 km from the main temple, having dimensions of 150 ft. length, 50 ft. breadth and 25 ft. depth. This mighty structure resembles like that of a typical Buddhist cave and prompts us recall the description of a Buddha Vihar by Hiuen T'sang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asta-Sambhu</p>
<p>In the district of Bargarh a large number of Siva Temple were built during the Chauhan rule of undivided Sambalpur. The most important among them were those of the Asta-Sambhu or 8 Siva Temples such as (1) Bimaleswar Temple at Huma (Sambalpur), (2) Kedarnath Temple at Ambabhona (Bargarh), (3) Baidyanath Temple at Deogaon (Bargarh), (4) Balunkeswar Temple at Gaisama (Bargarh), (5) Mandhata Baba Temple at Maneswar (Sambalpur), (6) Swapneswar Temple at Sorna (Bargarh), (7) Visweswar Temple at Soranda (Bargarh) and (8) Nilakantheswar Temple at Nilji (Bhatli). The Bimaleswar Temple at Huma on the Mahanadi was built by Maharaja Baliar Singh and the rest were built during the reign of Ajit Singh and his son Abhaya Singh. These temple, though small height, are great artistic beauty and each of these with picturesque background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dadhibaman Mandir : Dadhibamana Mandir is situated at Bhatli- one of the Block of Bargarh District. Dadhivaman is a form of Lord Jagannath and a parallel cart festival is organised accordingly. Bhatli is known as the Shreekhetra of Western Odisha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wild life Sanctuary Debrigarh</p>
<p>A peak in the Barapahar hills in Bargarh sub-division having a height of 2,267 ft (691 m). It was a noted rebel stronghold during the revolt of Balabhadra Deo, the Gond Zamindar of Lakhanpur, who was killed here. Mahapatra Ray and Baldia Ray also sought shelter here during 1840 AD after murdering Baluki Dash, the Maufidar of Bargarh. Veer Surendra Sai the freedom fighter was captured here in 1864 by British soldiers. There is a wild life sanctuary here. Except for elephants, wild buffaloes and blank Bucks most of the other important animals in the State of Odisha are more or less represented here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Bargarh is one of the many forts built by the Chouhan dynasty. Although no clear data is available about the settlement, the old fort walls can be traced near the 'Jeera' river towards the plains of Ambapali. From an inscription of the 11th century AD it is believed that the original name of the place was "Bahgar Kota". Balaram Dev, the Chauhan King of Sambalpur ruled this province when it acquires the name "Bargarh". He made it his headquarters for some time while the fort near the Jeera River was to be built. Narayan Singh, the last Chauhan King of sambalpur gave the whole land of Bargarh to two Bramhin brothers Krushna Dash and Narayan Dash, son of Baluki Dash who was killed in action by the Gond Rebel led by Baldia Ray and Mahapatra Ray.The Padampur sub-division of bargarh, popularly known as the "Borasambhar Region" was the headquarters of the Zamindari extended over 2178 km2. This is the biggest sub-division of Bargarh District which has also a feudal history with a tribal leader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buddhism played a significant role in defining the lifestyle of the people for a short period of time. Some ancient Buddhist monasteries and sculptures can be seen along a belt starting from Bijepur block (Ganiapali) to the Paikamal block (Nrusinghanath), which has a clear mention in Huen-Tsang's literature as Po-Li-Mo-Lo-Ki-Li (Parimalagiri) (Pasayat,2007, 2008).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legendary hero Veer Surendra Sai led his war against the British from Debrigarh, which is a peak on the Barapahad Range. His fight against the British Raj particularly after the First War of Independence in 1857 was remarkable in the history of freedom struggle in India (Pasayat and Singh, 2009; Panda and Pasayat, 2009). Debrigarh today is a tiger sanctuary. Barabakhra (12 caves) used to be a secret meeting place during this period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bargarh was a subdivision of old Sambalpur district until April 1992, when the then chief minister Mr. Biju Patnaik declared it as the headquarters of the newly formed district by the same name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demographics</p>
<p>As of 2011 India census, Bargarh had a population of 83,651. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Bargarh has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 57% of the males and 43% of females literate. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than Oriya speaking people who form the majority, the town has a some Marwari community who have migrated and settled down. Within the Oriya speaking population, the major communities are Kuiltas, Dumals, Agharias, Bhulia/Meher, Teli etc. Kuiltas and Dumals are presumed to be an offshoot of the original Chasa(agrarian) community and is synonymous with the Khandayats of the coastal region. This is evident by the striking similarity of rituals and the gods they pray. Bhulias were migrated to and settled in this region by some rulers, but the exact time period is controversial. Agharias were migrated from the mughal empire of Agra for establishing a cultivator community during war when Kuiltas were assigned the duty of part-time Kshatriyas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oriya is the language for communication, official purposes and for education.</p>
