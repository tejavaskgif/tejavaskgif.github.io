                    <p><p>Ludhiana District is one of the 22 districts in the state of Punjab in northwest India. It is the largest district of Punjab, by both area and population. Ludhiana city, the district headquarters, is the hub of industry in Punjab.[original research?] The main industries are bicycle parts and hosiery. Ludhiana is the biggest city of the state. It has eight tehsils, seven sub-tehsils and twelve development blocks. As of 2018, Total Population of Punjab is estimated to be 30,452,879 (30.4 million).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of 2011 census, the district population constituted 12.59% of the total Punjab population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ludhiana is a city and a municipal corporation in Ludhiana district in the Indian state of Punjab. Ludhiana is Punjab's largest city and India's largest city north of Delhi, with an area of 310 sq. km and an estimated population of 1,618,879 as of the 2011 census. The city stands on the Sutlej River's old bank, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south of its present course. It is an industrial center of northern India; the UK's BBC has called it India's Manchester. Ludhiana was among the list of smart cities that will be developed by government of India. According to World Bank Group[when?] Ludhiana is the best city in India to do business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ludhiana is 107 kilometres (66 mi) west of the state capital, Chandigarh, on NH 95, and is centrally located on National Highway 44, which runs from New Delhi to Amritsar. It is 315 km (194 miles) north of Delhi and 142 km (88 miles) southeast of Amritsar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rivers and drains</p>
<p>The Sutlej and its tributary, the Buddha Nala, constitute the chief hydrographic features of the district. A brief description of these is as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sutlej River</p>
<p>originates from Lake Manasarovar in Tibet. After flowing through Himachal Pradesh, it debouches from the Shivaliks. Just about Rupnagar, 32 km east of the boundary of Samrala Tehsil, it flows due west along the top of the district for 96 km and turns, as it leaves Jagraon Tehsil, slightly north toward its junction with the Beas at Harike. It maintains an east-west direction. It can be devastating during floods. The Sutlej has experienced a westward drift during recent times. Old towns and villages, such as Bahlulpur, Machhiwara, and Kum Kalan, were built on its banks. The river has since been dammed at Bhakhra, which has considerably checked its flooding menace in the district.</p>
<p>Buddha Nala</p>
<p>It runs parallel to the Satluj on its south for a fairly large section of its course in the district and ultimately joins the Satluj at Gorsian Kadar Baksh in the northwestern corner of the district. It floods during the rainy season, but in the dry season it can be crossed on foot at certain points. Ludhiana and Machhiwara are to the south of the Buddha Nala. The water of the stream is polluted after it enters Ludhiana City.</p>
<p>Ludhiana Tehsil</p>
<p>Ludhiana West Tehsil is a tehsil in Ludhiana district. It has 125 villages.</p>
