                        <h2>1. Kariyan</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/bb5d8a57-e8c3-427c-a68e-1268cb36f0fe_Kariyan.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>About 16-km northeast of the Rosera ghat railway station of Northeastern Railways the modern village of Karian is situated on a mound, 20-ft high from the surrounding ground level and about 96 acres in area. Local traditions associate this village to be the birthplace of Udayanacharya, a Maithil Brahmin and great philosopher of ancient times who is also supposed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Extensive excavations have revealed at this village antiques of as back as of 2nd century B.C. and afterwards from 6th century AD to post 1200 A.D.This village is the birthplace of philosopher and scholar Udayana alias Udyanacharya</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This village is called the karmbhoomi of famous udyana who was a great philosopher and &ldquo;shastarthi &rdquo; in the time of Kumarilbhatta. It is said that both of udayanacharya and kumarilbhatta stop the expansion of Buddhism&rsquo;s in eastern India. Udayanaachaarya Udayanacharya or Udayakara, a Brahmana logician of Mithila wrote a sub-gloss on Vachaspati&rsquo;s work called the Nyaya-vaartika-taatparya-tiikaa-parishuddhi. He wrote several other works such as the Kusumanjali, Atma-tattva-viveka, Kiranaavali and Nyaya-parishishhta (also called Bodha siddhi or Bodha shuddhi). UdayanAchArya (a &ldquo;tArkika-n&rdquo;) and Kumarilabhatta (a &ldquo;mImAmsaka-n&rdquo;). To the &ldquo;mImAmsakA-s&rdquo; the Buddhist&rsquo;s summary rejection of Vedic ritualismwas the proverbial red rag waved under the nose of a raging bull !Kumarilabhatta, it can be seen, has written copiously criticising the Buddhist&rsquo;s distaste for Vedic ritualism. He and UdayanAchArya were chiefly responsible for the failure of Buddhism to acquire a large following in the country. (Scholars mention here the texts of &ldquo;tarkapAdam&rdquo; ofKumarilabhatta and the &ldquo;bauddhadhikAram&rdquo; by UdayanAchAryA). Late Sanaknandanacharya was another baishnav saint belongs to Village Kariyan. A famous maithili poet Late Kali Kant Jha Buch was born at Kariyan. He wrote a huge nos songs, poems &amp; navgeet in maithili literature. A poetry collection named &rdquo; Kalanidhi&rdquo; was composed after his death.</p></p>

In 1905 AD, the foundation stone of the Agricultural Research Institute was laid on from 30,000 thousand dollars provided by Henry Philip, an American citizen in Pusa, by the then Vice-Governor and Governor General Lord Curzon. In 1911, the institute was renamed as Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research. In the year 1916, this institute developed two variants of wheat namely Pusa-4 and Pusa-12, which was awarded the first prize in the World Food grain Exhibition. It is worth noting that through extensive research work this institute developed various advanced discernment of paddy, wheat, tobacco, pulses, vegetables, oilseed and chilli for the farmers of the state and the country. Contribution of HM Lafray, T.V. flayer and H. S. Pruthi, the then scientist working in the institute has been a pioneer for the identification and prevention of insects on major crops. Similarly, for the research work on plant diseases, this institution has been praised at world level. The then scientist E.J. Butler, W.M. Makar, M. Mitra and V.V. Mundukar contribution in this direction is remarkable. For the research on fertilizer use and water management in crops, the then scientist Dr. J. W. Leather name is taken exclusively. It is notable that the first published bulletin, Pusa bulletin and Agricultural Journal of India (1912) was started by this institute to spread the developed techniques of the institute. In the year 1918, the institute was renamed as Imperial Agricultural Research Institute. Unfortunately, in January 1934, due to the terrible earthquake this institution had to suffer a lot of losses. As a result, the transfer of this institute was done in New Delhi in the year 1935. Again, in 1936, the Central Sugarcane station located in Muzaffarpur (Mushri Farm) was transferred in Pusa. Since its inception, the Research Institute of Pusa has had an unprecedented contribution towards developing advanced technology for sugarcane production in the state. Today, the name of Pusa has come not only in the field of agricultural research but also on the world map. Seeing the various agricultural institutions and their utility here, Rajendra Agricultural University was set up on 3 December 1977 for the development of the nation. While on the one hand, various faculties of the University are continuously getting innovative new achievements in the field of scientific education, research and dissemination under agricultural engineering, base science and home science, on the other hand, in 2011, establishment of Borolog Institute in the name of well-known agriculture Scientist N.E. Borlog is a matter of pride for the district and the state. In addition, a regional unit center of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, is doing research on paddy and wheat crops in Pusa.</p></p>
