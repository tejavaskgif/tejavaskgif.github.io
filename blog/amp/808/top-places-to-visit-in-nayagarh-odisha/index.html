<p>Ladukeswar Temple</p>
<p>This Shiv temple is situated at Sharanakula, a small town towards Odagaon Block. Maha Shivaratri is the important festival which is being celebrated every year. People from all parts of Odisha (mainly south Odisha) come to this place during the festival. The deity popularly known as "Ladu Baba" bestows blessing upon everyone. The temple is situated around 100 km from Bhubaneswar on the Nayagrah- Aska Road in Sharankul and 13 km away from Nayagarh town. The city is regarded as the golden merge of Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva). "Bolbam" is a traditional culture here for which people across different parts of Odisha visit the temple from their own towns by walking on barefoot and carrying a stick over their shoulder holding 2 pots of water from their town and finally put in the Ladukeshwar temple on the occasion of Shivaratri. The history of Ladukeshwar temple says that a cowherd used to take a couple of cows to the Bhandar mountain situated on top of Ladukeshwar temple now and one day he noticed that the cow automatically milks over a stone periodically everyday and one day when by mistake the cow put the leg on that stone, blood came out of the stone. To the very surprise, the cowherd told that story to village head and on that night one temple priest saw a dream of god speaking of establishing a temple over there. And the king agreed to it and established the temple. From that day onwards Ladukeshwar temple got established in Sharankul. In front of the temple, one monkey used to come for many days and sit at the exit of temple everyday and never ate anything offered by the public and died after few days, hence one small temple was built just outside the exit in the memory of that loving devoted monkey. The temple is now further restructured with more temples internally with further introduction of "Naba gunjar", Maa laxmi temple, haraparbati temple and floating stone of magical Ramsetu times etc. The history is very old and teaches us the culture in every respect.</p>

Goddess Dakshinakli came with the tantrik, but upon reaching Nayagarh when he asked Her now She can go, the goddess replied him as you have made me come here now give me shelter and I would not go back and even cursed him to be childless as She was the mother goddess and a son should not have done this even if he has great magical power.
