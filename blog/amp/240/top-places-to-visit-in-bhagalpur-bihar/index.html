                        <p><p>Mandar Parvat (Hill) is roughly 700 feet high. It is situated about 30 miles south of the Bhagalpur town in Bihar. There is an eastern railway line connecting Bhagalpur with Mandar Hill. Mandar Hill station is about three miles from Mandar Hill. There is also an all- weather road that connects Bhagalpur with Dumka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amrit Manthana or Samudra manthan which suggests that the hill was used by the gods to churn the ocean to procure amrit. The serpent, Basukinaga offered to serve as the rope and has left behind an impression of the coil on the granite hill. It is believed that panchjanya, the conch shell used in Mahabharat War, was discovered here in the Sank kund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The puranas refer to various sacred places on the hill which is also believed to be the abode of Vishnu under the title of Madhusudana or the destroyer of a demon called Madhu who was killed by Vishnu and then covered by the Mandar hill. Kalidasa's Kumārasambhava refers to foot prints of Vishnu on the slopes of Mandar. Besides inscriptions and statues, there are numerous rock cut sculptures depicting various Brahmanical images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hill is equally revered by the Jains who believe that their 12th Tirthankara attained nirvana here on the summit of the hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Near the place of salvation, a beautiful cave temple is viewable with a 5-foot-tall standing idol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><p>Vikramashila was one of the two most important centres of learning in India during the Pala Empire, along with Nalanda. It is located 38 km from Bhagalpur and owes its origin to Dharmapala (770-810 AD), the devout Pala king who loved to call himself Paramasaugata (chief worshipper of the Buddha)and was a great patron of Mahayana Buddhism. Dharmapala was impressed by two things which prompted him to establish Vikramshila. Firstly, the rocky hillock anchored around the confluence of Kosi and Ganga at Vateshwarasthan was not only a scenic attraction but a popular tantric site as evident from the presence of a Kali temple (instead of Parvati's) in front of Shiva temple, besides various other caves and rock cut sculptures dating back to the 6th or 7th century AD. Secondly, the place was associated with pilgrimage due to Uttarvahini Ganga which drew large crowds during Varsavardhana. Unlike Nalanda, sources of information on Vikramashila is confined to Tibetan texts and they make us believe that Dharmapala in his earlier birth was an accomplished acharya, Kampilya, who had attained siddhi or perfection in Mahayana mudra mysticism here and was determined to build a monastery one day.</p>

                        <h2>5. Maharshi Mehi Aashram, Kuppaghat</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/a3b27040-f066-4eb3-8047-88a87f17265c_Maharshi-Mehi-Ashram-Kuppaghat-Bhagalpur.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Lord Sadguru Maharshi Mehi Paramhansji Maharaj was a Sant in the link of Sants like Kabir and Nanak. He had attained perfection and was a God-realized Soul. His spirit-force was ever absorbed in the Logos and He was endowed with all the marks of a Sant.</p>
<p>The word 'Kuppa' means a tunnel or cave, and "Ghat" means place located on a river-bank. Accordingly, there is a cave at Kuppaghat which has been rendered famous and immortalised by Maharshi Mehi Paramhans, the legendary exponent of Santmat.Kuppa Ghat is a place located on the banks of the holy river Ganges at Bhagalpur, Bihar, India. Maharshi Mehi Ashram, Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur has, over the years, grown into a sacred pilgrimage for millions of followers of Santmat from India and abroad. The auspicious occasions of the birth anniversary of Maharshi Mehi Paramhans and Maharshi Santsevi Paramhans, the successor of Maharshi Mehi, who also made this ashram his main camp and residence, and Guru Purnima the ashram draw lakhs of devotees presenting a celebratory environment impregnated with piety. Maharshi Mehi practised surat shabd yoga or the Yoga of Inner Sound for several months here in this cave and later constructed his ashram also; several yogis or spiritual aspirants can still be seen practising the Yoga of Inner Light &amp; Sound in this dark cave completely insulated from the din &amp; bustle and brightness of the outside world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maharshi Mehi Ashram blossomed under his dynamic leadership to become the national headquarters of Akhil Bharatiya Santmat-Satsang. It has an aesthetically laid out garden and orchard beautifully punctuated with sculptures, paintings and quotes having spiritual significance like a cottage showing Lord Rama visiting great female devotee Shabri and killing of Jatayu, the vulture, at the hands of the demon king Ravana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to some unconfirmed accounts, Lord Gautama Buddha is also said to have lived in this cave in one of his previous births.</p></p>
                        <h2>6. Garuda (greater adjutant)</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/78feeb07-d50b-4f86-afb2-69c15bfb0a81_Garuda-greater-adjutant.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>World's Second Largest Rescue and Rehabilitation Area for Garuda is Bhagalpur. In Indian mythology, Garuda is considered the vahana or carrier of the god Vishnu. The mythical Garuda is staging a comeback - only this time in reality. Four years after these endangered birds of the stork family started nesting and breeding in Bhagalpur district, their number has increased over sixfold - from 78 to over 500.[7] Worldwide its population is about 1200-1300. They live in only three places; one is Cambodia and other two are in India. In Cambodia, the garuda population is about 150, in Assam the garuda population is about 650, and in the Bhagalpur district (around Kadwa Diyara, a place nearby Naugachia) the garuda population is about 500.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loss of nesting habitat and feeding sites through drainage, pollution and disturbance, together with hunting and egg collection, caused a massive dip in the population of the species. First spotted the Garuda birds nesting and breeding in 2007 on a silk cotton tree near a village in the Ganga-Diara area in Bhagalpur. In May 2006, 42 birds were seen by the Mandar Nature Club team for the first time. Prior to this, the species had never been seen in Bihar during its breeding period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The garuda, biologically known as greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List 2004 of threatened species and listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This huge stork has a naked pink head, a very thick yellow bill and a low-hanging neck pouch. The neck ruff is white. The bird looks like a vulture. Other than the pale grey edge on each wing, the rest of the greater adjutant's body is dark grey. Juveniles have a narrower bill, thicker down on the head and neck, and entirely dark wings. A Garuda bird measures 145&ndash;150 cm (about three feet) in length and four to five feet in height.</p></p>

The story is that of the Ganges on their way to the ocean in the Muni hismeditation interrupted by the fever of its currents. The wise man swallowed the river in one stroke. Bhagiratha Muni intervened and once again let her out by making an incision in the thigh. That is why the Ganges also called Jahnavi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sultanganj traditionally been part of a large state Anga. On the Day of the Mahabharata, Karna, the brother of the sixth five Pandavas, ruled Anga. The capital of Anga was Champa. This Champanagar Champa is located three miles west of Bhagalpur. King Karna had castles at Champa (currently Champanagar) and Jahnugiri (modern Sultanganj). Currently Champanagar, Karna the castle site, is well known as Karnagarh. Karnagarh is practically part of the town of Bhagalpur.</p></p>
