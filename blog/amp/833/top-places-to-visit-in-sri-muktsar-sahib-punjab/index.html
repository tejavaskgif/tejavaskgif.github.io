                    <p><p>Sri Muktsar Sahib district, colloquially known by the city's former name Mukstar; is one of the twenty two districts in the Indian state of Punjab. Its capital, the city of Sri Muktsar Sahib, was renamed from Muktsar to Sri Muktsar Sahib, with the district subsequently following suit. The district itself was historically referred as Khidraane Di Dhaab. Several other prominent towns in the district include but are not limited to Malout, the largest town in Sri Muktsar Sahib by population; and Giddarbaha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Muktsar Sahib is a city and district headquarters for the district of Sri Muktsar Sahib, located in Punjab, India. The 2011 Census of India put the total population of Sri Muktsar Sahib municipality to 117,085, making it the 14th largest city of Punjab, in terms of population. Historically known as Khidrana or Khidrane di dhab, the city was made the district headquarters in 1995. Chronological evidence indicates that the city was named Muktsar after the battle of Muktsar in 1705. The government officially changed the name of the city to Sri Muktsar Sahib in 2012, though the city is still primarily referred to by its unofficial name &ndash; Muktsar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Culture</p>
<p>The contemporary lifestyle of the city is still strongly grounded in the traditional Punjabi culture, though the residents have customized the modernization, retaining the elements of their original culture. People often tend to be conservative in thoughts, opinions and clothes as compared to bigger cities. Since Muktsar lacks any major industry interaction or activity, it is largely not impacted by the modern cosmopolitan culture. The city has a share of troubles as small towns are low on priority list of everyone. However, the traditional Punjabi culture in Muktsar is rich, emphasizing family values and respect for elders. Regional as well as national festivals - Lohri, Holi, Gurpurbs and Diwali - are celebrated with great fervor. Weddings in the city are an elaborate, expensive arrangement, with the rituals extending for days, accompanied with songs, music, dance, traditional dresses and food. Traditional dance forms include bhangra and giddha. Muktsar is well renowned for Muktsari kurta pajama and Muktsari jutti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Places of interest</p>
<p>Gurudwaras</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib, Muktsar</p>
<p>The main gurdwara in Muktsar is Gurudwara Tuti Gandi Sahib, which was built by the first Sikh residents of the city that settled in the city in 1743. The gurdwara has a large holy pool, and the darbar sahib is located on the western bank of the pool. The building has been renovated several times. The holy shrine was built in the memory of the 40 muktas who died fighting for the 10th Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Tuti gandi, which literally translated means "broken ties", which is referred to Guru Gobind Singh nullifying the document that he was no longer the Guru of the 40 Sikhs, in the context of the battle of Muktar. Though the gurudwara attracts several visitors a day, there is a massive devotee footfall on Mela Maghi, celebrated on 13 January every year. The gurudwara also celebrates other religious occasions like the birthdays of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Gobind Singh and the martyrdom of Guru Arjun Dev and Diwali, when the gurdwara is often illuminated. Shri Kalgidhar Niwas with forty rooms is available here for the devotees to stay during their visit. In the same premises, near the southeastern corner of the pool, is Gurudwara Tambu Sahib, which was built by Maharaja Mohinder Singh of Patiala. 50 metres away from the sarovar lies the Gurudwara Shahidganj Sahib. Built by Raja Wazir Singh of Faridkot, it is believed that it was here that Guru Gobind Singh cremated the bodies of the martyrs. Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib is also associated with the battle of Muktsar. It was this strategic spot that the guru chose to get a good view of the area, as that spot was located on a small hill, or a tibbi as called in Punjabi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located around 200 meters east of Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib, is the Gurudwara Rakabsar Sahib, where, according to Sikh chronicles, the stirrup, or rakab in Punjabi, of Guru Gobind Singh's horse snapped. Another gurudwara associated with Guru Gobind Singh in Muktsar is Gurudwara Sri Datansar Sahib, where he killed a Muslim enemy, when he was attacked while brushing his teeth with a datan, a traditional Indian toothbrush. Gurudwara Taran Taran Sahib, located on Muktsar-Bathinda road, is also associated with Guru Gobind Singh, where he halted while moving towards Rupana, after winning the battle of Muktsar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hindu temples</p>
<p>Muktsar has several Hindu temples, the prominent ones include Durga Mandir, Shiv Mandir on Kotkapura road and Mahadev Mandir. The city also has one Digamber Jain Temple located in Rambara Bazaar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mosque</p>
<p>The city has a historical mosque called Jamia Masjid. Also known as Angooran wali maseet, it was built in November 1894 by Nawab Maulvi Razav Ali Mian Badruddin Shah. It features minarets and domes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mela Maghi</p>
<p>An annual event celebrated in the month of January every year, the mela is organized as a tribute to the 40 Sikhs who died fighting for Guru Gobind Singh in the battle of Muktsar in 1705. Though the mela extends for more than a fortnight, the main event is held on 14 January, a day after Lohri, and is considered as one of the most important of all religious gatherings of the Sikhs. Sikhs consider it to be a pious occasion to take a dip in the holy pond of the Muktsar gurduwaras on that day. Despite the biting cold, devotees came in droves from Punjab and neighbouring areas, including Haryana and Rajasthan, to pay obeisance at Gurdwaras here. Apart from the religious activities, several political parties hold rallies in the city during the mela. The Mela celebrates the unique diversity of Punjabi tradition and culture in an ambiance representing the ethos of rural India. Several temporary stalls line the road selling a variety of wares from kirpans to kitchen-ware to refurbished clothing. A makeshift amusement park is created, which features circus, giant wheel, merry-go-round, wall of death, toy train and similar rides, along with food stalls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mukt-e-minar</p>
<p>In May 2005, the then chief minister of Punjab, Amrinder Singh, inaugurated Mukt-e-minar, which is the world's tallest khanda. An 81-foot double edged sword shaped structure, it has 40 rings around it, symbolizing the 40 Sikhs that died during the battle of Muktsar. The memorial was dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the last Mughal-Khalsa battle, where the Khalsa forces defeated the enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<p>Muktsar has a stadium called Guru Gobind Singh Stadium, with the facilities for athletics, basketball, football and kabaddi. The stadium is replete with a standard 400m competitive running track. The stadium also houses a large indoor sports stadium nearby, though presently it is in a state of neglect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The city's public school system, managed by the Government of Punjab, is administered by Punjab School Education Board, through government schools. The city also has a large number of private schools, affiliated with Central Board of Secondary Education, Punjab School Education Board and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muktsar has a number of colleges for higher education offering degrees in the major streams like arts, commerce, science, law and medical science. Notable colleges in Muktsar include Government College and Bhai Maha Singh College of Engineering. The city also has a Punjab University regional centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Places of Interest</p>
<p>Sri Muktsar Sahib and surrounding areas of Sri Muktsar Sahib city is intimately connected with Sikh history. Tuti Gandi Gurudwara Sahib, Tibbi Sahib, Gurudawra Rakab sar, Gurudwara Taran Taran Sahib are worth a visit to get a peep into the glorious era of Sikh tradition. The birthplace of Second Guru, Guru Angad Dev ji is at Sarai Naga 15kms from Sri Muktsar Sahib on Sri Muktsar Sahib- Kotkapura highway</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a beautiful old mosque called Angooran Wali maseet situated near Railway Station at Sri Muktsar Sahib. One historical Gurdwara Guptsar Sahib is situated at village Chhatteana in Gidderbaha tehsilat about 24 Kms from Sri Muktsar Sahib. Some historical Gurdwara at Rupana, Gurusar, Faqarsar &amp; Bhundar are situated in Sri Muktsar Sahib district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurudwara Tambu Sahib</p>
<p>Near the southeastern corner of the sarovar, marks the spot where the muktds took position behind trees and shrubs which they camouflaged to look like tents {tambu, in Punjabi). The present building, which replaced the old one built at the initiative of Maharaja Mohinder Singh of Patiala (185276), was constructed through kdrsevd during the 1980&rsquo;s. It comprises a high ceillinged domed hall, with a gallery at midheight and the sanctum in the centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurudwara Shahidganj Sahib</p>
<p>Also called Arigitha (lit. pyre) Sahib, about 50 metres west of the sarovar, marking the spot where the bodies of the martyrs were cremated by Guru Gobind Singh, was first built in 1870 by Raja Wazir Singh of Faridkot (1828 &ndash; 72). The new building, a rectangular domed hall, was reconstructed through kdrsevd during the 1980&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Darbar Sahib</p>
<p>The principal shrine at Sri Muktsar Sahib, is on the western bank of the sarovar and was the earliest to be established by the first few Sikh families who had settled here around 1743. Additions to the building were carried out by Bhai Desu Singh and Bhai Lal Singh, chiefs of Kaithal, and later by Sardar Hari Singh Nalva (1791 = 1837), one of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s army generals. During the 1930&rsquo;s Sant Gurmukh Singh Karsevavale and Sant Sadhu Singh renovated the building. They marblepanelled its walls, added decorative domes on top and paved the floor in and around it with marble. This edifice was, however, pulled down by his followers for reconstruction during the 1980&rsquo;s. A high tower and flagpost close to the Darbar Sahib were raised by Maharaja Hira Singh of Nabha (1843 &ndash; 1911) during the 1880&rsquo;s. An old van tree believed to have existed since before the battle of Sri Muktsar Sahib still stands between the Divan Asthan and the Nishan Sahib.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib</p>
<p>Marking the sandy mound from where Guru Gobind Singh had showered arrows on the enemy during the. battle, was first established as a modest structure during the eighteenth century, and reconstructed in 1843 by Sodhi Man Singh of ManSinghvala. The present building, which came up during the 1950&rsquo;s under the supervision of Baba Baghel Singh, a follower of Sant Gurmukh Singh, is a square hall with the sanctum in the centre. Above the sanctum is a square pavilion topped by a lotus dome and decorative marble kiosks at corners. The entire wall surface including the dome is lined with white marble. The floor in and around the hall is also marbletopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurudwara Rakabsar Sahib</p>
<p>200 metre east of Gurdwara TibbI Sahib, was also constructed by Baba Baghel Singh during the 1950&rsquo;s. According to local tradition, as Guru Gobind Singh came down from the tibbi and was going to mount his horse, the stirrup {rakdb, in Punjabi) snapped. Hence the name of the shrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The control of Sri Darbar Sahib and other shrines in Sri Muktsar Sahib, initially in the hands of hereditary mahants or priests, passed to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee in February 1923. The major annual celebration is on the Maghi day (midJanuary) when vast numbers of devotees throng the premises from all over for ablutions in the holy pool and to attend religious divans.</p>
