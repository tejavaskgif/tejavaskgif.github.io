                        <h2>1. Dwarkadhish Temple</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/9502c87d-fa4a-4f35-b230-01185eeefeae_Dwarkadhish-Temple.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Lord Sri Krishna temple in Gomati coast is holy, which temple is known as DWARKADHISH Temple. According to the opinion of the Department of Archaeology, This temple is 1200 years old. Logically estimated one great-grandson of Lord Sri Krishna Vajranabhe Earlier, around 1400 BCE samudrama dubhi surviving remnant of the house of umbrellas established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main temple at Dwarka, situated on Gomti creek, is known as jagat mandir (universal shrine) or trilok sundar (the most beautiful in all the three worlds). Originally believed to be built by Vajranabh, the great grandson of Lord Krishna, more than 2500 years ago, it is a glorious structure seeming to rise from the waters of the Arabian Sea. Its exquisitely carved shikhar, reaching 43 m high and the huge flag made from 52 yards of cloth, can be seen from as far away as 10 km. The grandeur of the temple is enhanced by the flight of 56 steps leading to the rear side of the edifice on the side of the river Gomti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple is built of soft limestone and consists of a sanctum, vestibule and a rectangular hall with porches on three sides. There are two gateways: swarga dwar (gate to the heavens), where pilgrims enter, and moksha dwar (gate to liberation), where pilgrims exit.</p></p>
                        <h2>2. Bhadkeshwar Mahadev</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/0fc094fd-c4ce-45c3-9cd7-c5f14e8faf2a_Bhadkeshwar-Mahadev.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Around five thousand years ago, a Shivalinga was revealed in the Arabian Sea, today we knowns as Shri Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Mandir. In the month of June/July, the ocean itself perform abhishekam the Shivling, and for some time this temple becomes the part of the ocean. The most famous festival of the temple is Maha Shivratri, on the day of Shivratri, a grand fair is organized around the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built on the very edges of Dwarka is a Shaivite Temple of absolute bliss and rapture. Located on a hillock on the Arabian Sea to the extreme west of Dwarka, the Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple is quite close to Geeta Temple and Rukshamanee Temple. There are very few words to describe the ethereal beauty of the Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple. With a well-built path leading up to the hillock from the shore and stairs leading straight to the temple itself, accessing Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple is rarely an issue. As it is built off the shore, the ebb and flow of ocean water flood the surroundings of the temple as well the path leading up to it. This is not really much of a hindrance, but rather adds to the beauty of it all.</p></p>
                        <h2>3. Gomtighat</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/5e97aeb8-bdf9-45de-a84a-0d4c205e8656_Gomtighat.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>At Dwarka city there is a holy Gomatighat where there are many temple including Gomati Mataji temple. Gomatighat&rsquo;s bath is a wonderful honor. By renovating this Ghat, More facilities and Safety has been made for Pilgrims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the banks of river Gomti, there is a Shiva temple, as well as smaller shrines of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Krishna&rsquo;s friend Sudama around the ghat, where pilgrims have worshipped for at least 100 years. One can also hire a boat and move across the river to get a panoramic view of Dwarka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gomti Ghat is situated at the mouth of the river. A bath in these waters is believed to purge the soul. The solemnity of this belief contrasts with the lively atmosphere of boys jumping into the waves and turning somersaults as people photograph them.Decorated camels,tea stands,and bearded men selling seashell jwelry by the water add to the ambience. The banks are dotted with innummerable shrines dedicated to Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Samudra (God of the Sea).</p></p>
                        <h2>4. Gayatri Shaktipith</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/687ce979-d66d-4fed-ad53-6a7b8183c61b_Gayatri-Shaktipith.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Since 1983, Shri Gayatri Shaktipeeth is the only temple of Gayatri Mata in Dwarka. One dharamsala is also associated to facilitate religious pilgrims. The devotees come here with great reverence for worshiping Maa Gayatri, and The temple is a very special gathering point for the Gayatri Family during Dham yatra. At least once a year, the Annakut is organized on the foundation day of the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaktipeeths are a very important in context to the pilgrimage for Hindus. These sites hold a mythological importance for the Hindus. It is given in the Hindu mythological texts that Lord Brahma, the creator of the whole universe performed a yajna and asked lady Shakti to help him in creation of the whole universe and lady Shakti from the lord Shiva and helped him in creating the whole universe. It was decided that lady Shakti would be born in human form and take place by lord Shiva&rsquo;s side as his wife to help him in his role of running this universe efficiently. Lord Brahma&rsquo;s son performed a yajna to get lady Shakti as his daughter and it was already decided that lady Sati who was lady Shakti in human form would be wed to lord Shiva. But because lord Brahma&rsquo;s fifth head was cut off by lord Shiva&rsquo;s curse due to his lie, Daksha who was lord Brahma&rsquo;s son hated lord Shiva and didn&rsquo;t want his daughter lady Sati to be wed to him but lady Sati saw lord Shiva and fell in love with him and as result was married to him.</p></p>
                        <h2>5. Sudama Setu</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/cd183b89-3ad6-4d9f-bf44-6580a4f27708_Sudama-Setu.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The bridge will become an added attraction for devotees and tourists as it will be illuminated with LED lights and will connect the Shri Dhwarkadheesh&rsquo;s Jagat Mandir with Panchnad Tirth (Panch Kui).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sudama Setu is dedicated to the name of Sant Sudama who was a great friend of Shri Dwarkadhish. This is a newly built suspension pedestrian Bridge over the Gomti river. Which connects Island to the mainland where temple of Shri Dwarkadhish is situated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other side of the bridge there is awesome Dwarka Beach with Pristine blue colour water. From there you can also have the amazing memerizing view of Dwarkadhish Temple and Gomti Ghat along with City. Camel ride and bike ride are good to enjoy in the beach. Across this Setu is One old Laksmi Narayan Temple and Five Pandavas Wells. Sea Beach is about 200 hundred meters away from this place. For photography, This Setu and it&rsquo;s surrounding Areas offer best opportunities. Along the river bank is paved way with seating arrangements till the place where Sea and River meet. An awesome Sunset can be witnessed from this meeting point. It was a wonderful experience with singing waves, winds and birds along the sea Beach.</p></p>
                        <h2>6. Shardapith Temple</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/1830d29a-2ad2-47a9-b5be-9471d9cc07ef_Shardapith-Temple.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>At the end of the 8th century and beginning of the 9th century, Shree. Jagadaguru Adyasankaracaryaji had established up Shardapith which is one of the monastery out of 4 monastery of Adyasankaracaryajina. Currently sankaracaryaji is sitting in 78 Ministry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aadi Jagat Guru Shankaracharya, the most reserved religious dignitaries of Hindus, founded Shardha Peeth at Dwarka, one of the four pioneer seats, created set up in four different directions of India. True to its name Shardha, that is the Goddess of Knowledge Saraswati, Dwarka&rsquo;s Shardha Peeth is an important knowledge centre that propagates and preserves the Hindu religion, culture and Sanskrit language. Sharada Peeth is just adjacent to the mythological Dwarkadheesh&rsquo;s Jagat Mandir. The ambience of the place is very holy and righteous and is the right place for one to find solace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shardha Peeth is believed to be over 250 years old and is visited every year by thousands of pilgrims from across India. Adi Shankaracharya found this Peeth in 491 AD for withholding the traditions and religious beliefs of India. This Peeth is also known by various names like Kalika Matha, which is in charge of the Sama Veda, the Paschimamnaya Matha and the Western Matha. Besides this it has also a collection of oriental materials which are believed to also have remains of old Dwarka that was submerged in the sea and some other old stony things. It also has preserved bomb-shells which Pakistanis threw during air-raids during 1965 war but could not damage Dwarka.</p></p>
                        <h2>7. Nageshwar Jyotirling</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/89d552fd-9414-46a5-bda5-12c8042713e5_Nageshwar-Jyotirling.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Located on the route between Dwarka city and Beyt Dwarka Island on the coast of Saurashtra in Gujarat is this important Lord Shiva Temple. It is enshrined by one of the 12 swayambhu (self-existent) jyothirlingas in the world, in an underground sanctum. A 25 m tall statue of a sitting Lord Shiva and a large garden with a pond are major attractions of this rather serene place. Some archaeological excavations claim five earlier cities at the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nageshwar was believed to be known as &lsquo;Darukavana&rsquo;, which is an ancient epic name of a forest in India. Below are well-known legends attached to this mystical temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the legend, &lsquo;Balakhilyas&rsquo;, a group of dwarf sages worshipped Lord Shiva in Darukavana for long a time. To test their devotion and patience, Shiva came to them as a nude ascetic wearing only nagas (serpants) on his body. Wives of sages got attracted to the saint and went after him, leaving their husbands behind. Sages got very disturbed and outraged by this.They lost their patience and cursed the ascetic to loose his linga (one of the limited meanings is Phallus, but it has has a deeper theistic symbolism). Shiva linga fell on the earth and the whole world trembled. Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu came to Lord Shiva, requesting him to save the earth from destruction and take back his linga. Shiva consoled them and took back his linga. (From Vamana Purana CH.6th &amp; 45th). Lord Shiva promised his divine presence in Darukavana as &lsquo;jyothirlinga&rsquo; for ever.</p></p>
                        <h2>8. Narara Island</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/d780dafe-470b-417e-961f-380b959b95ad_Narara-Island.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place is located near Vadinar. Nearest city is jamnagar which is around 40-50 kms away.

                        <h2>9. Bet Dwarka - Dandi Hanuman</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/024054e4-4d26-4be0-a742-713f9e6a7f44_Bet-Dwarka-Dandi-Hanuman.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Five kilometers east of the Beyt Dwarka main Sri Krishna temple there is a magnificent and unique temple for Lord Hanuman. It is more popularly known as Dandi Hanuman Temple. How this temple is unique is more interesting. To know how unique the temple is, let us take a brief stroll into the mythological lanes of Ramayana. While there are many version about Ahi Ravan, Mahi Ravan and Makaradwaj the following descriptions of Sri Ahi Ravan and Mahi Ravan is unique to the Maharashtra Bajanasampradhaya especially followers of Sri Aanantha Dhanaya Deva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One can see a club placed between them. It seems there is no need for the club here. Sri Hanuman in relaxed and joyous mood, Sri Makaradwaj is also seen enjoying what he is doing and relaxed. There is no club or any other weapon in the hands of these two. In Gujarat the joyous mood, merry and melancholy are expressed with &lsquo;Dandi&rsquo;. It is no wonder that this temple where Sri Hanuman and Sri Makaradwaj are virajman is called &lsquo;Dandi Hanuman&rsquo;, meaning joyous Hanuman.</p></p>

                        <p><p>Shri Halar &ndash; Tirth Aradhanadham is located on the bank of the Sinhan River in the Midst of the pleasing sound of the rippling waves of water of the dam, near the gardens of various fruits, on the shore of the western sea, This impressive tribute to Jainism spread over 40 acres of land bordering the on the Jamnagar Dwarka highway Devbhumi Dwarka district of Gujarat, India. The serene and peaceful and environment friendly complex is an excellent example of Jain architecture and structure. It is a pilgrimage destination for Jain devotees from all corners of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For getting peace of mind, Jain temple and Lord Jineshwara are both very useful. They are the main support of spiritual sadhana. Knowing this Vaghjibhai decided to construct a big marvelous temple in Aradhana Dham for the People native and foreign. He asked blessings from shri Mahasenvijayji Maharaj. But what a great tragedy! Pujyashri was also gone away. But his divine power helps from Heaven in the creation of Holy Halar Tirth. In 2043 Ashadha Suda Bij foundation was laid by Vaghjibhai under the aucipicious of Acharya Dev Shrimad Vijay Pradyotansuriswarji Maharaj and Param Pujya Panyas Pravar Shri Vajrase Vijayji Maharaj.</p></p>
