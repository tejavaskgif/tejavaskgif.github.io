<p>Culture and tradition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ukhrul town</p>
<p>Ukhrul is dominated by the Tangkhul Nagas. They have a rich culture. Each cultural activity is centred on the propitiation of deity known as "Kameo". They have their own traditional folk dance known as 'pheichak'. Pheichak occupies an important place in the life of the Tangkhul. There are many forms of pheichak and every pheichak depicts or expresses the life of the people. Raiyot is the war dance which is performed before and after going to war. Luivatyot, shomkhapyot, luirayot etc. are different forms of pheichak associated with the agricultural life of the people. The life and art of the tangkhul are attractive and captivating. Their different costumes, utensils, architecture, monuments and memorials depict their dexterity in art, which also speak of their sense of beauty and finesse. Though there are common costumes and clothing, both for males and females, there are also some costumes and clothing patterns exclusively meant for male and female. Some of the traditional clothes are:</p>

<p>Music and dance</p>
<p>Tangkhuls are music lovers and their songs are soft and melodious. Apart from encoding into the music the varied seasonal and cultural ideas and philosophies, music is a medium wherein historical events are also related in the lyrics. In as much as religious fervor is incorporated and composed in the songs, the romantic nature of the people also finds its expressions in the music. There are various varieties of songs, some are mood special, some are festival/seasonal specials. These folksongs and folklores can be taught and sung by anybody, anytime, but there are also some specific musical expressive melodies of every region or area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These folksongs and folklores can be played or accompanied by musical instruments. Some of the musical instruments are the tingteila (violin), tala (trumpet), phung (drum), mazo (woman's mouth-piece), sipha (flute), kaha, and ngashingkhon (bamboo pipe).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corresponding to the rhythmic composition of the songs, the dances of the Tangkhuls are also rhythmic and these are eventful and vigorous. Thrilling as they are, there are also some special occasional dances, like the Kathi Mahon - dance for the dead, Laa Khanganui - virgin dance during Luira Festival, Rain Pheichak - war dance etc. Many young Tangkhuls have initiated the continuation of the old folk form into modern Popular culture. An attempt by Reuben Mashangva to infuse folk lyrics and melody into modern songs are a good examples of the young trying to come to term with the past and their western /Christian oriented tradition of music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The present Tangkhul music can be divided roughly into the following categories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folk song: A purely uncontaminated songs that has been handed down by the ancestors through oral tradition. Such songs are sung during the traditional festival like, Luira, Mangkhap, Thisham and therleo phanit.</p>
<p>Gospel song (Vareshi Laa) are songs translated from the Christian hymnals, which includes all the Christian popular songs. these songs are promoted by the various Church associations and are sung in the church.</p>
<p>Lungchan Laa (romance song) is the most popular type of songs sung by the youths. It is western in tone and melody but retain the symbolic and lucid beauty of the traditional songs. In fact the lungchan laa can be consider as the pop songs of the community.</p>
<p>Folk Blue: Started by the well known folk singer Reuben Mashangva in the late 1980s, this style has almost become a movement of blending the past with the present. many scholars and writers have taken keen interest in knowing and exposing the style.</p>

<p>The house structure is more or less similar for all the villages, but the carvings on the posts and blinks vary from village to village and area to area. To display the splendour and wealth of the rich and noble families, tree trunks - tarung are erected in front of the house. Some even erect monumental/memorial stones in the courtyards or at some prominent sites in the village area. Construction of all these entails strict ritualistic procedures and norms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dress</p>
<p>The Tangkhul wear a colourful traditional dress. Women wear 'kashan' and 'kongsang' while men have their shawl known as 'haora'. However, as with the rest of the world, they have been rapidly westernized as a result of globalization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The first Tangkhul primer was published by the Rev. William Pettigrew in 1898. Since then much literature has come up. The complete Bible was translated and published in 1936. The Tangkhul Literature Society, the premier literary institution of Tangkhul Nagas, was formed in 1937.

Among the three constituencies the constituencies of Phungyar and Ukhrul have produces candidates of repute and have even occupied the Chief Minister's post. The Tangkhuls are highly politically aware tribes, though the British introduced the direct electoral politics to them they are not new to the system of electing a leader through consensus and selection.
