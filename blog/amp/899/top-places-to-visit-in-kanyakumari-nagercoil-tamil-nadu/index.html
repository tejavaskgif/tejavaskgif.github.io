<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kanyakumari district is the southernmost district in Tamil Nadu state and mainland India. It stands second in terms of population density among the districts of Tamil Nadu and the second most urbanized, next only to Chennai district. It is also the richest district in Tamil Nadu in terms of per capita income, and also tops the state in Human Development Index (HDI), literacy and education.&nbsp; The district's headquarters is Nagercoil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kanyakumari district has a varied topography with sea on three sides and the mountains of the Western Ghats bordering the northern side. Except for a small stretch of land to the west of Kanyakumari town, almost the entire district is sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea - the only district in Tamilnadu state facing the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geologically, the landmass of the district is much younger when compared to the rest of the state - faulted as late as 2.5 million years during the Miocene, after which numerous transgression, as well as regression of sea, had shaped the western coast of the district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It was part of the princely state of Travancore during the colonial times prior to India's independence; four of the eight tehsils of Thiruvananthapuram district were separated from erstwhile Travancore Kingdom to form the new district of Kanyakumari, and they were made the part of Madras Presidency under recommendations from the States Reorganisation Commission in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of Tamil Nadu state.</p>
