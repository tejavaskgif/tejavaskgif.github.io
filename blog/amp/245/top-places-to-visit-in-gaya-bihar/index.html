                    <p><p>Gaya is of historical significance and is one of the major tourist attractions of the state of Bihar. Gaya is 100 kilometres (62 mi) south of Patna, the capital city of Bihar. It is the state's second-largest city, with a population of 470,839, and is the headquarters of Gaya district and Magadh division. The city is surrounded on three sides by small, rocky hills (Mangla-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila, and Brahmayoni), with the Phalgu River on its fourth (eastern) side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaya is sanctified in the Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist religions. Gaya district is mentioned in the great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. It is the place where Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, came to offer pind-daan for their father, Dasharath, and continues to be a major Hindu pilgrimage site for the pind-daan ritual. Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha is said to have reached enlightenment, is one of the four holy sites of Buddhism. The Mahabodhi Temple complex at Bodh Gaya is a World Heritage site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Etymology</p>
<p>Gaya is named after the demon Gayasur (meaning "the demon Gaya"). According to Vayu Purana, Gaya was the name of a demon (Asura) whose body became pious after he performed strict penance and secured blessings from Lord Vishnu. It was said that the body of Gayasura was transformed into the series of rocky hills that make up the landscape of Gaya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Culture</p>
<p>Pilgrimage</p>
<p>The city of Gaya is a holy place of Hinduism, with a great number of Hindu deities represented in the engravings, paintings and carvings of its shrines. Of particular importance are the sites in the city associated with Vishnu, in particular the Phalgu River and the shrine Vishnupad Mandir, or Vishnupada, which is marked by a large footprint of Lord Vishnu engraved in a basalt block.Gaya is the location at which Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, offered pind-daan for his father, Dasharatha. Gaya has since remained a site of key importance for the performance of the pind-daan ritual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearby Bodh Gaya ("Buddha Gaya"), so named to distinguish it from the Hindu town centre of Gaya, is one of the four holiest sites of Buddhism and the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>World Heritage site at Bodh Gaya</p>
<p>The Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya was listed as a World Heritage site by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at its 26th session, on 26 June 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 50-metre-high (160 ft) Mahabodhi Temple central to the complex was first built by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. The main part of the present structure dates from the 5th&ndash;6th centuries CE. It is one of the earliest and best-preserved Buddhist temples built entirely of brick dating from the later Gupta period. The Bodhi Tree (Ficus religiosa), the most important of the sacred places within the complex, is reputedly a descendant of the original tree under which Siddhārtha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Marking this seminal moment, Bodh Gaya is one of the four holiest pilgrimage sites of Buddhism, with Lumbini, Sarnath and Kushinagar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The various structures on the site have undergone a number of restorations over the centuries. Ongoing maintenance and management is required to protect the complex which, as a major pilgrimage site, is under pressure due to large numbers of visitors. The site is under the responsibility of the state government of Bihar, and is managed by the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) and Advisory Board under the Bodh Gaya Temple Act, 1949.</p>

                        <h2>1. Mahabodhi Mandir</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/c8a34399-2916-4f1d-93ba-90f4e093198b_Mahabodhi-Mandir.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Mahabodhi Mahavihara is the most sacred place of Buddhist Pilgrimage in the world.</p>
<p>The gold painted statue of Buddha in the sanctum shrine of the Temple is made of Black stone built by the Pala kings of Bengal. The Buddha is seen seated in the Bhumisparsa Mudra or the Earth touching posture.</p>
<p>The Mahabodhi Mahavihara has now been declared a World Heritage Property by the UNESCO on the 27th June 2002.</p></p>
                        <h2>2. Vishnupad</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/5e944424-6a31-40d7-a531-83d9c24d7a16_Vishnupad-temple.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Gaya is located 100 kilometers away from the capital city of Patna. Historically, Gaya was the part of the ancient Magadh Empire. The city is located on the bank of Falgu River and is considered among one of the most sacred cities for Hindus. Three hills Mangala-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila and Brahmayoni surround it from three sides and make at a safe and beautiful site. Gaya is an ancient place and has great heritage and history. Various modes of transportation connect Gaya with other major cities of Bihar along with rest of India</p>
<p>Gaya is sacred not only for Hindus but also for Buddhists, as the place has many Buddhist pilgrim destinations. These sacred places in Gaya correspond to physical features, most of which occur naturally. The bank sides of river Falgu and temples located on the bank are beautiful and attractive. A peepal tree standing on the bank of Falgu River called Akshayavat is considered sacred for Hindus. The tree is worshiped for its divinity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mangla Gauri shrine who is believed to be the first wife of Lord Shiva is worshiped here. The two rounded stones that symbolize the breasts of the mythological Sati have been considered sacred among Hindus. The most attractive destination in Gaya is Vishnupad Temple. The temple is located on the bank of river Falgu River and has footprint of Vishnu incised into a block of basalt. People believe that Lord Vishnu killed Gayasur by placing his foot on Gayasur&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>The old temple of Vishnupad was later renovated by the queen of Indore, Devi Ahilyabai in eighteenth century. While Hindus claim that footprints in Vishunpad temple are of Lord Vishnu, Buddhists consider them the footprints of Lord Buddha. The temple is nevertheless a major pilgrim destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nomenclature of Gaya is based on the myth of demon Gayasur who Lord Vishnu had killed in a dual. The place is so sacred for Hindus that even Lord Ram had performed Pindadanam here for his ancestors. Legend says that Lord Ram had come to Gaya to pay homage to his ancestors and Sita had accompanied him on his way. Gaya is equally important for Buddhists as this was the place where Lord Buddha preached the Fire Sermon i.e. Adittapariyaya Sutta to around 1000 agriculture workers who were fire-worshipers. The influence of Buddha&rsquo;s discourse was so enormous that all of them converted to Buddhism.</p></p>
                        <h2>3. Bodhgaya</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/eec32db1-a5a5-4bc8-ba22-b1f41cbfc4e1_Bodhgaya.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Bodhgaya is one of the most important and sacred Buddhist pilgrimage center in the world. It was here under a banyan tree, the Bodhi Tree, Gautama attained supreme knowledge to become Buddha,the Enlightened One. Born; in the foothills of the Himalayas as a Sakya prince of Kapilvastu (now in Nepal), most of the major events of his life, like enlightenment and last sermon, happened in Bihar. Buddhism as a religion was really born in Bihar and evolved here through his preaching and the example of his lifestyle of great simplicity, renunciation and empathy for everything living. Significantly, the state&rsquo;s name of &lsquo;Bihar&rsquo; originated from &lsquo;Vihara&rsquo; meaning monasteries which abounded in Bihar. Several centuries after Buddha&rsquo;s passing away, the Maurya Emperor Ashoka (234-198 BC) contributed tremendously towards the revival, consolidation and spread of the original religion. It is the monasteries, Ashoka built for the Buddhist monks and the pillars known as Ashokan Pillars erected to commemorate innumerable historical sites associated with the Buddha&rsquo;s life, mostly intact to this day, that helped scholars and pilgrims alike to trace the life events and preaching of a truly extraordinary man. There is a magnificent Mahabodhi temple and the Tree from the original sapling still stands in the temple premises. The temple is an architectural amalgamation of many centuries, cultures and heritages. While its architecture has a distinct stamp of the Gupta era, it has later ages inscriptions describing visits of pilgrims from Sri Lanka, Myanmar and China between 7th and 10th century AD. It is perhaps still the same temple Hieuen Tsang visited in 7th century.</p></p>
                        <h2>4. Thai Monastery</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/9da76690-112b-48ab-a5da-727140605ace_thai-monastery.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>One of the oldest foreign monasteries built in the ornamental regal Thai architectural style. The grandeur of the exterior as well as the interior is utterly awe-inspiring. The temple reflects like a red and golden gem over a calm pool at the front patio. The splendid Buddha idol along with the mural paintings depicting Buddha&rsquo;s life and some modern events like importance of planting trees painted in a stylized manner are utterly marvelous. It is situated next to Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya.</p>
<p>Visiting Hours: 7:00 AM to 12:00 AM, 02:00 PM to 06:00 PM</p></p>

                        <p><p>Gautama Siddhartha is believed to have meditated at this place for 6 years before he went to Bodhgaya for the final realization. Two small shrines are built to commemorate this phase of Buddha. A golden emaciated Buddha sculpture memorising the rigid penance is enshrined in one of the cave temples and a large (about 6&rsquo; tall) Buddha&rsquo;s statue in the other. A Hindu goddess deity Dungeshwari is also placed inside the cave temple.</p></p>
                        <h2>6. Baba Koteshwarnath Temple</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/b71a6b2c-a5e7-4441-b3dc-b683253afe4f_Baba-Koteshwarnath-Temple.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
