                    <p><p>Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972 bifurcating Kottayam District. At that time, the district headquarters was at Kottayam. In June 1976 it was moved to Painavu. Idukki lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Idukki is the second largest district in area but has the lowest population density. Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated whereas villages are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala.</p>

<p>Tourist Spots</p>
<p>Munnar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tea plantations in Munnar</p>
<p>Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes. Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the north east, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park to the north, the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south and the proposed Palani Hills National Park to the east.These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including Nilgiri Thar, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramakalmedu stands tall in the Western Ghats at a height of 3500 feet above sea level. The ecosystem of the area consists largely of grass land Shola forest type which is laced by sporadic bamboo forests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constant wind is another factor which makes Ramakkalmedu unique. Wind blows at a speed around 35 km/ hour at Ramakkalmedu throughout the year irrespective of the season and time.Tourism villages like Pushpakandam and Kuruvikanam near Ramakkalmedu is one of the places in Kerala where wind energy farm is installed, though it is private holdings. Currently the capacity is at about 12.5 MW.This electricity is distributed to Kerala State Electricity Board.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marayur</p>
<p>Walkway through the sandalwood forest</p>
<p>Marayur is a remote village on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. The relics of new stone-age civilisation has been unearthed here. It has ancient stone cabins, called 'Muniyaras', and is the only place in Kerala having natural growths of sandal wood trees. Marayur has more than 1000 species of flowering plants and is a well known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of Aibizia lathamii, a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar &ndash; the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur &ndash; has recorded the largest number of reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas of south India in avian diversity. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, guar, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri thar, common langur, bonnet macaque etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maryoor has got a number of sandalwood forests. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of local economy and a depot near Marayur town is supporting this industry. Sandal wood or Santalum album is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as &lsquo;liquid gold,&rsquo; is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93 km2 Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted. The auction rate for first quality Marayur sandal is quoted at Rs.1100 per kg, according to forest department sources (2004).</p>

<p>Culture</p>
<p>Culture in Idukki is mixed since it constitutes of migrated people from other parts of Kerala and native tribals. Presence of a large number of tribal population is peculiar to Idukki District. Kovilmala, near Kattappana in Idukki is home to one of the still ruling Tribal Kings in India, Kovilmala Raja mannan. iIndigenous art forms in Idukki are not as popular as other major art forms. Tourist areas like Munnar and Thekkady welcome people by hosting popular art forms like Kathakali.</p>

<p>Rail</p>
<p>At present there is no railway in and to Idukki district of Kerala. The nearest railway stations are Kottayam (station code &ndash; KTYM), Aluva (Alwaye, station code &ndash; AWY), Ernakulam South (Ernakulam Jn., station code &ndash; ERS) and Ernakulam North (Ernakulam Town, station code &ndash; ERN).</p>
<p>Air</p>
<p>The nearest airport to Idukki is Cochin International Airport and Coimbatore Airport. Airport Authority of India's plan to set up an airport in Anakkara is in a conflict of environmental issues. Anakkara Airport will be a great leap in Idukki's complete development. The government claims this project will improve the tourism in the area. However, with Anakkara being situated in environmentally sensitive Western Ghats, environmentalists and villagers argue that this can significantly impact the area's climatic conditions and livelihood of people. Also the land identified for the project is one of the very few remaining paddy fields of the district, currently cultivating some of the rare indigenous varieties of rice which increases the concern about the project. Those opposing the airport also cite the economic benefits as Munnar, one of the key target destinations for the airport lies at about 100 km from Anakkara and the time taken to reach there from Cochin International Airport is less than the time taken to reach from Anakkara. Though there are no clear references online from the government on the objectives, benefits and purpose of the proposed airport, anti-anakkara-airport groups have set up social networking campaign sites such as Save Anakkara Blog and Anti-Anakkara Airport on Facebook explaining reasons why they claim the airport project should not be implemented.</p>

<p>Neriamangalam Bridge</p>
<p>The Neriamangalam Bridge, built across the Periyar river, is often referred as 'The Gateway to the Highranges' as it is on the way to the higher regions of Idukki district, especially Munnar. The bridge was made by His Highness The Maharaja of Travancore in 1935.</p>
