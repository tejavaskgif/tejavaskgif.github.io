<p>Prithviraj Chauhana, who also ruled Delhi for a while, had set his heart on Menal, and it became his favourite mountain retreat when the Rajasthan summer would set in. For this he built a palace on the banks of the Menal river which runs over granite slabs before finally plunging into a gorge over 122 metres deep. The entrance to the mansion is via a two storied gateway carved with images of the gods Ganesha and Bhairava. The square courtyard beyond the entrance houses a huge Shiva temple of stone, built in the ancient Hindu style with a carved pagoda and pillars. The walls of the temple are carved with motifs of Hindu deities and various other themes, interspersed with images of elephants. Of special mention are the images of Shiva and Parvati which form the chief subject of the engravings. Shiva and Parvati are depicted in various postures and surrounded by dancers, musicians, lesser gods and animals. Halfway up the pagoda is a large stone lion, perhaps depicting victory. A number of smaller ruined temples lie around the Shiva temple.</p>
