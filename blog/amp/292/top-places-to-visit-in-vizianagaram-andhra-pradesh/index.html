                        <p><p>Vijayarama Raju-I laid the foundation of Vizianagaram fort in 1713 A.D. on the auspicious day of Vijaya Dashmi. The Victory arch was the main entrance to the Vizianagaram fort prior to the construction of Nagaar Khana. It has a temple of Lord Hanuman on one side and Goddess Lakshmi on the other. The Goddess is also known as &lsquo;Kota Shakti&rsquo; or the guardian of the fort. The Raja of Vizianagaram would seek blessings of the Goddess before embarking on any military expedition. The main entrance to the fort is through the East Gate. Nagaar Khana is situated atop this gate. &lsquo;Nagaara&rsquo; is an Indian percussion instrument. A literal translation of &lsquo;Nagaar Khana&rsquo; would mean &lsquo;Drum Room&rsquo;. It was used for drawing attention of the people for announcing royal edicts. The drummer also used the Nagaara to announce and alert the inmates to the arrival of royal guests. The West Gate is the rear entrance to the Vizianagaram fort. This gateway is built in Rajasthani style and has a viewing pavilion on top. It connects the fort to the Pedda Cheruvu and to the royal tombs. As per Hindu customs and traditions, the deceased should be taken for cremation only from the rear door of the household. The West Gate with the royal tombs close by served this purpose. The fort was surrounded by a moat. The area between the west wall and the moat has been converted into a splendid park with well laid out gardens and lush green lawns by the present day administration.</p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spiritual destination</p>
<p>While a traditional Vishnu temple is part of the complex, the RAMANARAYANAM is more spiritual than it is religious. In fact, right from the time when work on the park began, artists/artisans from across religions and Cities have been integral parts of the project. Cities have been integral parts of the project. The PRANAGANAM is home to a huge library with over one lakh spiritual books, where visitors can browse through the many texts and also attend the cultural events that regularly take place here.

Envisioned to be more than a traditional temple for people to offer prayers, the idea was to promote it as a spiritual centre where people could see the scenes from Ramayana and take away the essence of human values from the Holy epic. Choosing just a few scenes from the large epic was a challenge and Sri Narayanam Nageswara Rao and other family members discussed /debated with scholars on the subject across the nation and then meticulously chose 72 important episodes from the epic to be converted into pictorial sculptures. Artisans from across the nation were enlisted to carve the pictorial sculptures with intense detailing carefully thought out, creatively crafted the RAMANARAYANAM leaves an ever lasting impression in the mind of beholder. Accessible by road, though the theme park has started functioning since an year ago, it sees a footfall of thousands of people each day more than 25 lakhs pilgrims visited till date.</p>
