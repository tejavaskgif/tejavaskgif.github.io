<p>Sabalgarh Fort</p>
<p>Amongst the monuments of the medieval age, the fort of Sabalgarh is worth visiting. The beautiful 'Bandh' built behind the fort in the Scindia period has made the whole scene most fascinating. The foundation of Sabalgarh was laid by a 'Gujar' named Sabla in the past. Construction of the fort on a somewhat high cliff was made by Gopal Singh, the Raja of Karoli. Sikandar Lodhi sent a big army to hold control over this strongly built fort. The Marathas in their campaign of northern India again won it and gave it back to the king of Karoli. But in the year 1795 A.D. it was again taken from him by Khande Rao, whose big house still stands there. Lord Vallejali Daulat Rao Scindia (1764-1837) lived in the Fort of Gwalior during his regime.
