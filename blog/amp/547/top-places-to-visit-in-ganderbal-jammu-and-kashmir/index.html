<p>&nbsp;</p>

Now Ganderbal constituency is represented by Sheikh Ishfaq Jabbar who defeated qazi afzal by a little margin of 461 votes in recently held state assembly elections 2014. The State government has not shown seriousness towards the development of the district. The only Central University of Kashmir Valley is being constructed in district Ganderbal. One Faculty, the Faculty of Forestry of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir is under construction at Benhama, with the objective to boost the economy and education of the district, which is well behind at present. Besides, there is a stadium which holds a record of playing a day-night matches Physical education college, the only one in the state, is situated at {Gadoora Ganderbal} some 3.5&nbsp; km away from district headquarters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historic sites and remains</p>
<p>No significant ancient building or archaeological site is found in the district today- save for the Naranag temple- as most of the ancient architecture in the area was destroyed during the rule of Sultan Sikandar Butshikan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kheer Bhawani</p>
<p>Kheer Bhawani is a temple dedicated to the Goddess Bhawani constructed over a sacred spring in village Tulmullah. The term kheer refers to rice pudding that is offered in the spring to propitiate the Goddess, which became part of the name of the temple. As is the custom with Hindu deities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naranag Temple</p>
<p>The Naranag Temple is one of the important archaeological sites of the country. Naranag, a group of temples, is situated in the lap of Harmukh Mountain about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Srinagar city. The site consists of a cluster of temples facing each other at a distance of about 100 metres (330 ft). Historians say that the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva by the 8th-century ruler Lalithdatiya Muktadiya. It is believed that the King Awantivarman paid a visit and donated a pedestal for bathing at Bhutsher. Even today one gets surprised over art and skill of the builders of this temple. Its impressive architecture reveals the glorious past, the magnificent art of the 8th century. The government has only recently constructed walls to protect it from encroachments and nothing else has been done. It is now left in ruins of which only faint traces have survived.</p>

The Mughal garden, called the Garoka, (meaning bay window) built by Nur Jahan overlooks the lake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lake is a good place for birdwatching as it is one of the largest natural stamping grounds of aquatic birds in Kashmir and has the sobriquet of "supreme gem of all Kashmir Lakes".

Harmukh is part of the Himalaya Range, and is located between Sindh River to its south and Neelum River to its north. It rises from Gangabal Lake in the vicinity of Kashmir valley. It is more hazardous to reach Mount Haramukh from the east and south side of Ganderbal and has never been climbed from these sides; thus, it is mostly climbed in the north-west from the Arin Bandipore side.</p>
<p>Harmukh was first climbed by the Great Trigonometric Survey's Thomas Montgomerie in 1856 and made the first survey of the Karakoram some 210 km (130 miles) to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labelling them K1 and K2. Harmukh was later climbed by many other climbers. Therefore, Harmukh is the mountain from which the world&lsquo;s 2nd highiest mountain peak K2 was discovered and the Serveyer&lsquo;s mark K2 continues to be the name.</p>
