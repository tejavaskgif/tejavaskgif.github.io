Among the famous graves in the churchyard are those of Josiah John Goodwin, the British stenographer of Swami Vivekananda, and William Patrick Adam, the British governor of Madras, whose grave is topped by the stunning pillar monument dedicated to St. Thomas, the tallest structure in Ooty. The church&rsquo;s graveyard was used as a setting in David Lean's 1984 movie, A Passage to India, which was based on E. M. Forster&rsquo;s novel of the same name.</p>
