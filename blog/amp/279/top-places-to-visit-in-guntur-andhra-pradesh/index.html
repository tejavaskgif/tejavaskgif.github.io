<p>Undavalli Caves</p>
<p>A short drive away from Guntur and Vijayawada are the Undavalli caves, a striking specimen of Indian rock-cut architecture. The historic caves are located at the top of the high hills overlooking the Krishna River. Built during the 4th-5th century, their structure suggests that they were hewn out of solid rock on the hillside. Dedicated to Anantapadmanabha Swamy and Narasimha Swamy, Undavalli Cave Temples are associated with the Vishnukundina kings. It is also believed that Buddhist monks used these caves as rest houses. A remarkable 5 metre long figure of Vishnu reclining on the serpent couch - Anantasayi is the focal point of the second storey of the Caves. The sculptures are testimony to the dexterity and skill of the artisans of the ancient times. The caves are located 6 km south west from Vijayawada(7 from RTC Bus stand, Vijayawada), 22 km north east of Guntur City and about 280 km from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>Uppalapadu Bird Sanctuary</p>
<p>Uppalapadu is a place of bird migration and a village near Guntur City. It is also a reputed bird sanctuary. Home to around 40 species of migratory birds from Siberia including pelicans and white ibis, this sanctuary is equivalent to Pulicat Sanctuary in Nellore District. From countries like Siberia, Australia, Painted Storks, Spotted Pelicans and other birds migrate to this sanctuary. Many species birds including endangered Spot-Billed Pelicans and Painted Storks take refuge in this water tanks in the village. The bird population here is around 7000, however birds about 12000 were roost in this dwindling habitat through the year. But some initiatives have taken place such as adding artificial trees, local awareness, proper water supply to the ponds etc. The artificial trees are added in the pond on which the birds can perch in addition to the natural trees. Uppalapadu is just 5 kms from Guntur, 270 Kms south of Hyderabad.&nbsp;</p></p>
