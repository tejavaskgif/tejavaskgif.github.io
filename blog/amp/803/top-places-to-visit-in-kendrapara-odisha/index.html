In the year 1866 the great famine NANKA miserably affected the People of Odisha by causing thousands and thousands of starvation death. The King Radhasyam Narendra stood up and supplied food grains to secure no starvation death in the state of Odisha. The then Queen Elizabeth acknowledged the generosity of the King and accorded free gun use without licence as a token of gratitude. She also wrote a letter of thanks which was delivered by then Commissioner Ravenshaw Saheb to the King. Not only this before famine George Campbell the then Governor of Odisha recommend the name of Radhashyam Narendra to be enthroned as GAJAPATI as the then Gajapati Maharaja was ailing and also childless. This could not be materialised due to Maharani brought stay order from Patna High Court by adopting a son. All British emissaries who were used to come to Kendrapara rested at Badakotha Non the less the building became a rest place of West and East. It was a place of Governance since inception. Once it was a place of religious sanctuary where Sadhus from all over lndia used to come and used to stay for four months of rainy season. It was a practice Sadhus used to come to Puri to worship Lord Jagannath then they came to Kendrapara to worship elder brother of Lord Jagannath Lord Baladeva. Sri Radha Gobinda Jew s temple of King Narendra s was the place of congregation of all Sadhus. Sadhus were fed and the King met all other necessities. This long stay of Sadhus inspired people and they came close to them. Through interaction people learnt Hindi and other Hindustani cultures. Apart from Naga and other Sadhu like Mohapurusa Arakhita Das remained here and went Olasuni cave for meditation. Sadhus like Sri Chaitanya Deb Sri Ram Das Sri Madhu Das Sri Fagu Das and Bala Baba were in touch with the family and rested at Badakotha.

Badakotha is so popular among general public that it stands as an instance in public talk for quality richness and purity. History narrates the migrated Jana brothers Jana Kurup Singh &amp; Jana Anup Singh were nephew of Rana Jasobanta Singh the then Maharaja of Jodhpur were settled at Panikoili under Jajpur area near Jagannath Sadak. All pilgrims including Sadhus used to pass by that road to visit Lord Jagannath. Once an epidemic started and killed many passers by. This Jana family served them and saved many lives. Among those Sadhus some brought the notice of the Gajapati Moharaja about their magnanimity. Gajapati sent messenger to bring those two brothers to Puri. Two brothers met Gajapati and narrated the story of their plight due to Rana Ajit Singh s (son of Jasabanta Singh) unilateral ceasefire with Aurangzeb which compelled them to leave Kingdom. Gajapati was not convinced and asked them to give a test of their cast and creed. The brothers agreed. Younger brother Anup Chandra told his elder brother he will give the test first. Accordingly Anup rode a horse and ordered to go. A sword was hanged on such a height the passer had to bend his head at the time of passing on riding the horse. As both the brothers were Kshatriya by cast the younger brother s did not bow his head and was beheaded. Gajapati did not allow the elder brother to give the test.This act of bravery pleased the Gajapati and settled them there where they were staying and named the place as Jodha Gada. ln Course of time Gajapati Ram Chandra Deb II was arrested by Muslim Subedar Taqui Khan and was imprisoned at Barabati Fort. The then Rajguru asked Jana Kurup Singh to help and free the Gajapati. Jana Kurup with the help of platoon of Khurda Paika killed Taqui Khan and freed the Gajapati.

The aspect of governance from pre independence to post independence the dynasty and Badakotha played a significant role not limited to time. After invasion Marahatta s ruled India and Subedars used to come to Badakotha to consult the course of action for governance. Britishers were also do the same.
