                        <h2>1. Bagheswari Hill</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/7d205035-9f6d-4559-bdb7-bef59879cf40_bageswariroad.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>This is a famous tourist spot where one can find an ancient shrine of Lord Shiva. The Bhageswari Hill houses ancient Shiva temple inside a stone cave flanked either side by another two temples mainly temple of Bhageswari and Baba Tarak Nath. The temple is a stone cave. From the highest point of the hill, one can see a beautiful view of the whole Bongaigaon city.</p></p>
                        <h2>2. Koyakujia Beel cum Park</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/5bf8d7d1-46e3-4f37-b4ab-2589dcd12456_Koyakujia-Beel-cum-Park.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Nature gives men stones- Men creates sculptures out of them. When the labor is combined with aesthetic sense, the nature also pours its blessing by gifting its beauty. Koya Kujiya, we can call it as Gods own creations if mans interventions was not there. We can call it as man made paradise, it is not a natural landscape. But it is the junction of intermingling nature&rsquo;s beauty and human labor. The wordless worth Beauty Queen Koya Kujia is located near the town of Abhayapuri, the Debodaru Nagari. Once the capital of Bijni Raj Estate, now tending towards a tourism destination because of escalating fame of Koya Kujiya Eco Park. The oblong shaped Beel of 86.6 hect, combined with number of small islands through which the enrooting water body is spread along is the new attraction for the tourists who visit this part of the country. The Oblong shape park consist of 11 nos of Tilas (islands) around where the beautiful water body is running around. Surrounded by the Malegarh Pahar Range, where the sunset is melodious reflecting its rays in waters of Koya Kujiya Beels is inexpressible in words. Boating in Koya Kujiya through the channels in between the small islands where sky touching Sal Trees are standing gives immense pleasure and altogether a different experience.</p></p>
                        <h2>3. Rock Cut Cave (Jogighopa)</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/abfc626e-5b62-404a-9054-43fc102e5c91_Rock-Cut-Cave-Jogighopa.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The best specimens of the architecture of the Salasthambha period are the remains of the five rock-cut caves at Jogighopa on the bank of the Brahmaputra in the district of Bongaigaon. These are the unique examples of rock-cut architecture in Assam. Though these rock-cut caves are not of such architectural interest as those in Western India, but these remains at Jogighopa are the clear evidence of the fact that Assam was not outside the movement of this particular type of art developed in India as it will be seen from description of the best preserved cave noticed at Jogighopa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cave measures 2.60 m breadth ,1.8 metre in depth and 1.90 meter in height and also a roughly rounded ceiling and in front a verandah 75 cm long by 35 cm broad. A platform of brick and mud masonry is found inside which is obviously a later addition. A chase running across the entire breath of the cave on the top serves to drain away rain water from the facade. Flights of steps have been cut into the rock on either side and ledge on the top diverts the rain water from the facade. The cave bears no sculptural designs. The other caves at the site have no flights and verandah and smaller in size than the best preserved one.</p></p>
                        <h2>4. Tamrannga Beel</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/3fba4bb5-dbcb-4511-8b3e-ebd3ee601bcb_tamranga.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>

                        <h2>6. Lalmati Duramari Ganesh Mandir</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/933985bb-8579-4624-b1b4-d0ee52200bd6_Lalmati-Duramari-Ganesh-Mandir.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The Lalmati-Duramari Ganesh Temple near Abhayapuri town under North Salmara Sub-Division, is one of the oldest temples of the state.The historicity of the images are yet to be ascertained. But after a study of the stone carving and modes related to the carved idols, archeologists opine that the temple and images belong to 8th to 10th centuries AD. There are three views advanced as the reason for destrcution of the temple . The first view has it that eartquakes during the 8th and 10th centuries destroyed the temple and its images, while according to type second view, Kalapahar who revolted against worshipers and priests, destroyed the temple along with other temples and images in the North-East. The third view has it that Burmese(Maan) invaders who camped at Malegarh(Manegarh) hills destroyed the temple along with the idols. But it seems that eartquake has been the prime cause of the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>The existance of ruins in Lalmati-Durgamari area along with temples and images was brought to the notice of the Historical &amp; Antiquarian Department of the Govt. of Assam in 1974. The department undertook excacation work which resulted the discovery of the temples, images and idols of the Gods and Godesses. The site of temples is teemed with natural beauty and the Govt. can upgrade the place to a major tourist attraction. The temple managing committee and local people urged the Govt. to blacktop the road from Naldaba to the temple site and take steps to beautify the area.</p></p>
