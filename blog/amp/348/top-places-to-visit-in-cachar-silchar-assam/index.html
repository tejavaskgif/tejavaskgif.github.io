                        <h2>1. Khaspur</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/f87a7652-b9de-4eee-971d-0b1c9b8ed85e_Khaspur.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>A beautiful village, Khaspur is located only 20 km from Silchar, in Cachar district of Assam. It houses the ruins of the Dimasa Kingdom,which are a magnificent sight to see. There is a king&rsquo;s temple, a Lion Gate, and a Sun Gate and these are centuries old. The king&rsquo;s palace is almost non-existence but the main entrance gates still stands tall. These gates are in elephant pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally a part of the Tripura Kingdom, Khaspur was ruled by a tributary ruler. It became independent after the fall of Koch power. As the last of the Koch ruler died, the control of Khaspur went into the hands of Kachari rulers and they shifted their capital to Khaspur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POPULAR THINGS TO DO AND SEE IN AND AROUND</p>
<p>The vicinity of Khaspur to Silchar, makes it a popular tourist destination in Assam. Khaspur is a small village and there is nothing much to see here apart from the archaeological ruins. However, since Silchar is near, tourists have other options as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maibong is a beautiful hill station that you can visit. It is a bit far but the journey is worth it. From spectacular views to amazing ancient architecture, this place offers you all. Umgranshu, located in North Cachar is another place that you can visit. It is also a scenic hill station and there is also a hot spring nearby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GETTING THERE</p>
<p>Khaspur has no railway station nearby. Silchar is the connecting link and this is where you need to travel to. Silchar railways station, 20 km away is the nearest one and there are regular trains to major cities of India from here. Many rental cabs are available from this station.</p></p>
                        <h2>2. Bhubaneswar Temple</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/3709b70e-8eff-4f8a-983d-f3efaef0fb99_bhubaneswar-temple.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>During the festival of Shivratri, thousand of Shivayats march towards this Bhubaneswar Temple perchedatop a hill. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this is one of the most famous temples in South Assam. Located near Silchar, in Cachar district, this temple is located on the top of Bhuvan Hills and attracts pilgrims from near and far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bhubaneswar temple is crowded with devotees on the night of Maha Shivaratri, and thus prior travel and lodging arrangements are recommended to avoid the rush</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This place doesn&rsquo;t only attract pilgrims but hikers as well as there is no motor road to reach this place. The hike distance is 17 km from the plains. Though, it is not easy to reach the top of the hill, many people do so as the view from the top is beautiful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POPULAR THINGS TO SEE IN AND AROUND</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not possible to travel again immediately after a trek of 17 long kilometres. People who come to the temple, stay at the temple for a couple of hours before heading back to Silchar, which has more places to see. Silchar is located at a distance of 50 km from Bhubaneswar Temple. There is no other tourist spot nearby and in order to see more place you would need to travel to Silchar. The view of the surrounding hills is spectacular and you would love to spend hours seeing it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bhubaneswar temple is a 2-hours drive from Silchar. Since, there is a dirt track to the top of the hill, walking is required. This distance is of good 17 km and it can take a lot of time to reach the temple.</p></p>
                        <h2>3. Kachari Fort</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/1d2643d4-1421-44d8-af5d-f94781c526f9_kachar-fort.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>The Cachar district in Assam has a very important historical connection as it used to be the capital of the Cachar Kings during the medieval times. One such famous historical fort here is the Kachari Fort which is considered to be one of the magnificent forts to be visited in this area and tourists come here to see the remains of this kingdom at Khaspur which makes the place more interesting. It reflects the rich cultural heritage of the ancient era through the fine quality of work done by the engineers of those times. The fort is covered on all sides by the lush greenery which makes the place picturesque. The beautiful carvings on the walls of the fort depict the life style that the people of Assam had in those times. This fort used to be the pride of the Kachari kingdom and the existence of this site even today enhances the glory of Assam. Visiting this fort is a treat to the eyes as you get to see the heritage of the state which has been preserved with a lot of effort. Although the walls of the fort look worn out due to ages, but the smell of our ancient days makes the place worth visiting. You get the touch of both Hinduism as well as the Non Aryan culture at the Kachari Fort</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POPULAR THINGS TO DO &amp; SEE IN AND AROUND</p>
<p>The fort is a great place for a stroll during daytime, apart from this site, travelers also find interest in the nearby attractions like Sri Kancha Kanti Devi Mandir, Maniharan Tunnel, Bhubaneswar Temple and Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd. All these places are located within driving distance from the fort and can be reached by planning a local sightseeing tour in a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GETTING THERE&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Silchar Railway Station is the nearest junction to Khaspur; from here there are many local transportation systems like rental cars and auto rickshaws that carry tourists to the Kachari Fort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
                        <h2>4. Accommodation</h2>
                        <amp-img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/sumitc91.github.io/master/Blogs/cc28f73e-c957-40c2-b63f-3669840ab632_hotel-kalpataru-cachar-assam.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1484" height="600"></amp-img>
                        <p><p>Cachar still remains a lesser explored region, and thus, the number of the accommodation places here is quite less. Most of the travellers stay in Silchar which has comparatively more hotels than the other places of the region. Silchar has some high end hotels as well along with budget options, which makes it the most preferred place to stay in Cachar region. There are few government circuit houses and lodges here and there in the area that can also provide decent accommodation.</p>
